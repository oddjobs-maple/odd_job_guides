"A swashbuckler, variously wielding a short gun and a pair of Sky Skis")

The **swashbuckler** is an odd job/odd build in MapleStory that represents
everything from the winsome outlaw, to the rugged highwayman of the sea, to the
vigilante hero of the people. As their name suggests, they are well-versed in
the use of blades (particularly swords and spears) and even shields, but any
good swashbuckler always has a gun also at the ready. Unlike the woodsman, who
is a master of the _classical_ martial arts, swashbucklers are tough-as-nails
vagabonds with more than a few tricks up their sleeve &mdash; not the least of
which is their gun. As a result of this &mdash; including the
swashbuckler&rsquo;s ability to summon their marine animal friends to fight
alongside them &mdash; swashbucklers are considerably more versatile than the
more specialised woodsman. Whether the swashbuckler is embattled in a
chivalrous fight for justice, ransacking a foreign sea vessel, or just winning
a bar fight, two constants remain: the swashbuckler&rsquo;s impressive
versatility, and their lovability in spite of their scampishness.

This guide, unlike my other guides in this series, lives partially in the
shadow of another guide, &ldquo;[How to become a living meme: the STR Corsair
Mage edition][mage]&rdquo; (due to **Fraiche**), which can be found on the
MapleLegends forums. The aforementioned guide is also dedicated to
swashbucklers (in _some_ sense; perhaps &ldquo;STR sair&rdquo; is the better
term here), but I believe it to be unfortunately responsible for a number of
misconceptions surrounding the job. In particular:

- That swashbucklers are oriented entirely towards fourth job &mdash; and,
  furthermore, just a single skill thereof.
- That swashbucklers are inept at marksmanship.
- That swashbucklers are a &ldquo;meme&rdquo; job unworthy of consideration,
  other than as a one-trick pony.
- That spears are the only viable melee weaponry for swashbucklers (this one is
  only slightly incorrect).

Thus, this guide has two tasks upon it: one is to be a swashbuckler guide, and
the other is to avoid confusion with the now-common (mis)conception of what
&ldquo;STR sairs&rdquo; are, hopefully dispelling some myths in the process.
Like the other guides in this series, fourth job is not touched upon, so Aerial
Strike will not even be mentioned, other than within this sentence.

It&rsquo;s also worth mentioning that &ldquo;proper&rdquo; swashbucklers are
DEXless, contrary to the aforementioned guide&rsquo;s suggestion to add roughly
1 DEX per level; this is not itself a misconception &mdash; as the guide does
not claim to be a swashbuckler guide &mdash; but the difference should be noted
to avoid confusion.

## A quick note on the name

This job is referred to throughout this document as &ldquo;swashbuckler&rdquo;
(plural &ldquo;swashbucklers&rdquo;). This job is also commonly referred to by
simply prepending &ldquo;STR&rdquo; (or &ldquo;strength&rdquo;) to the name of
the ordinary job in question &mdash; e.g. &ldquo;STR outlaw&rdquo;. To avoid
confusion with DEX gunslingers who have a base STR higher than 4 (i.e. normal,
but also not STRless, gunslingers), &ldquo;pure STR&rdquo; can be prepended
instead of simply &ldquo;STR&rdquo;. Other names for this job include:

- Swashie \[[diminutive](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-ie#English)\]
- Cowgirl/cowboy
- STR slinger
- Pure STR slinger
- STR sair
- Pure STR sair

## Pros and cons

Discussing the pros and cons of the swashbuckler as a job can only be done with
the understanding that the swashbuckler _is an odd job_, and is therefore
inherently suboptimal in many ways (if it weren&rsquo;t, we would be very lucky
indeed to be able to call it an &ldquo;odd&rdquo;, or &ldquo;unusual&rdquo;,
job).

Pros:

- Ability to engage in ranged combat and in melee combat, with equal
  proficiency.
- Excellent mobility, with Wings &mdash; and, with gun equipped, Recoil Shot!
  Also Dash, although I personally refuse to use it simply because it
  can&rsquo;t be unbound from the arrow keys&hellip;
- High aggregate DPS with Somersault Kick, high single-target DPS with Double
  Shot/Burst Fire.
- Cute summons that fight alongside you for extra damage!
- Ability to do ranged combat at all as an odd job, considering that most odd
  jobs are essentially stuck with melee only.
- Fewer accuracy issues than many other jobs (including some odd jobs), due to
  having a head-start on their DEX (20), focusing on DEX for equipment, and
  having skills like Bullet Time and (when in ranged combat) Gun Mastery.
- 100% reliability stun due to Blank Shot &mdash; and it hits 3 monsters, to
  boot!
- Homing Beacon can be invaluable when fighting a boss.
- Extremely stable damage at range, due to getting most damage from STR
  (secondary stats are unaffected by mastery) and due to a lack of crits.
- Charismatic charm and the spirit of adventure.

Cons:

- Switching between ranged combat and melee combat is not as seamless as one
  would hope, because you cannot be in an &ldquo;alert&rdquo; (i.e.
  &ldquo;catching your breath&rdquo;) stance while switching weapons. Contrast
  this with gishes, who may not be able to do _physical_ ranged damage, but can
  nevertheless cast ranged spells and do physical melee combat, both without
  switching weapons at all.
- Considerably worse accuracy in comparison to an ordinary gunslinger, due to
  having a base DEX of exactly 20.
- Although Somersault Kick deals impressive damage (especially considering that
  it can hit up to 6 monsters at once), its reach is pitiful, requiring the
  swashbuckler to get as close as possible to their enemies when in melee.
- Unfortunately not as good at ranged combat, nor at melee combat, as some
  other jobs are (particularly non-odd jobs, i.e. ordinary/mainstream jobs).
  Given the same equipment, any ordinary gunslinger build (STRless or
  otherwise) will be able to outperform you at range (although you will
  outperform them at melee, of course). Any warrior, bandit, or brawler build
  that could be considered &ldquo;standard&rdquo; or &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo;
  in any way will likely be able to outperform you in melee from at least third
  job onwards, and possibly earlier as well (although you will outperform them
  at range, of course).
- Swashbucklers, like woodsmen, suffer from [an almost complete lack of
  defences](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon). Hopefully
  you&rsquo;re not playing permadeath!

## AP build

Swashbucklers are defined, in part, by their AP build:

- STR: \[all other APs go here\]
- DEX: 20
- INT: 4
- LUK: 4

First job is pretty straightforward: Somersault Kick, Bullet Time, Double Shot.
The single leftover SP can be put into either of Flash Fist or Dash.

Personally, I put into Flash Fist, in order to avoid Dash triggering on arrow
key presses; however, swashbucklers do not use knucklers, so the skill itself
is _almost_ totally useless. Do note, however, that Flash Fist _is_ usable with
a gun equipped (although you won&rsquo;t be able to use it with a melee weapon
equipped). The usual understanding of swashbucklers precludes the use of Flash
Fist (because it is considered to essentially be a brawler skill), but as long
as you never use it with a knuckler equipped, no one is going to call you a
fake swashbuckler!

We get early points in the two mobility skills for what utility they have at
level 1. They are considerably worse than at max level, but still a lot better
than having level 0 in both. Rushing level 6 Gun Booster is a priority here,
for extra fast shootin&rsquo;. Mastery is next for the damage and sweet, sweet
accuracy (very welcome, due to our pure STR nature). Beyond this point, we
already basically have the first thing that we want from our gun: solid
single-target DPS. Next comes the mobility (yes!!), and then the
stun/crowd-control.

Invisible Shot is more-or-less our last priority (other than maxing Gun
Booster, but we already had 6 SP in it anyways) because:

- It basically feels like a second-job-only skill, because even Burst Fire (a
  single-target attack) can meet or exceed its performance in many cases, and
  then there&rsquo;s Ice Splitter and Flamethrower, of course.
- Mobbing is not a huge priority at range, because unlike DEX slingers, we can
  resort to melee for that.

The leftover SP can be distributed as you see fit; note that Grenade is
more-or-less useless (like it is for DEX slingers as well&hellip;). It would
actually be an amazing skill, if it lacked the restriction that you must have a
gun equipped when using it. Considering how unwieldy it is to use with a gun,
it hits like a wet paper towel, and is thus only useful for luring mobs (as far
as I know). And even then, with the time needed to charge it up, you may as
well Recoil Shot over to your enemies, at that rate. So if you&rsquo;re not
like me, you&rsquo;ll put most of those leftover SP towards maxing Dash.
Personally, I have Grenade at level 11, thanks to my allergic reaction to Dash.

We start off here by getting access to some of the meat of third job: Octopus
and Gaviota (your summons!), and Homing Beacon. Homing Beacon is unfortunately
only usable with a gun equipped, although it is possible to use it and then
switch to melee. But it does really work as advertised: it has an infinitely
long duration (well, as long as the target never dies&hellip;), and will cause
you to always strike the target any time that it&rsquo;s possible for you to do
so (i.e. you&rsquo;re in range and aiming in the relevant direction),
regardless of any other enemies that would obstruct your attack.

Then we save up some SP, because Burst Fire is unfortunately only better DPS
once it&rsquo;s at roughly level &ge;11 or so. It could possibly vary a bit,
due to factors like the target&rsquo;s WDEF, but 11 is pretty much the magic
number here. Burst Fire comes first, because we want to improve our gun at what
it&rsquo;s good for: single-target DPS.

Then the summons come next. They are just generally useful, since they can be
summoned regardless of the weapon that you have equipped. Finally, something to
do in melee other than Somersault Kick! Unfortunately, their damage only scales
on three things:

- DEX.
- STR.
- &ldquo;Attack rate&rdquo; (as listed in the description of the skills; the
  name is somewhat misleading, because it actually does _not_ change the attack
  speed).

&hellip;And DEX is more important than STR here, by a factor of 2.125 on
average. This is kinda bad news for the swashbuckler, but it&rsquo;s really not
so bad: STR still contributes a lot, the attack rate is ultimately the most
important component, and these lil guys ignore WDEF entirely. Nice.

Then we get Ice Splitter to level 26. DEX outlaws more usually level up Ice
Splitter and Flamethower side by side, and use both in order to (somewhat)
effectively take out mobs of enemies when training. For the swashbuckler,
however, we have Somersault Kick for that; our gun is primarily focussed on
single-target DPS. So Ice Splitter is leveled up here in order to provide some
crowd control (Ice Splitter freezes its victims in place), e.g. for bosses that
spawn minions. We leave Ice Splitter at level 26 (although of course, you can
use your leftover SP to max it out) because higher levels of the skill offer
nothing other than a slight damage boost, which is not important for this crowd
control skill. You can still use Flamethrower (and Invisible Shot, for that
matter&hellip;), particularly with the leftover SP, but if you want something
that looks a little more like a traditional outlaw build, see &ldquo;Outlaw
(hybrid)&rdquo; below.

Note that in any case, if we want to max both of our summons, we cannot do the
traditional method of maxing Flamethrower _and_ getting Ice Splitter to level
&ge;26; there&rsquo;s just not enough third job SP. We _have to_ (begrudgingly)
max Homing Beacon, in order to have access to Bullseye in fourth job.

This build is more-or-less the same as the standard swashbuckler outlaw build
above, except that we try to emulate traditional outlaw skill builds here, once
we max out Gaviota. Again, the SP just doesn&rsquo;t work out, so we end up
with both Ice Splitter and Flamethower only hitting up to 5 targets at once.

If you _really wanna_ be like A Real Outlaw&trade;, it is perfectly possible to
go with a more traditional outlaw skill build &mdash; that is, more traditional
than the two given in this guide. The main reason why I don&rsquo;t really
recommend this route is that Ice Splitter and Flamethower are slightly&hellip;
underwhelming skills, even for DEX outlaws. Their reach isn&rsquo;t all that
impressive, and neither are their damage percentages. The situation, then, is a
good bit different than that of [the third job
woodsman](https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/guides/woodsman/#ranger-archery-specialisation)
and their signature multi-target attack: Arrow Rain/Eruption. Plus, woodsmen
have no multi-target attacks in melee; you, on the other hand, do.

## Itemization

A swashbuckler is nothing without her equipment and her gear&hellip;

### Equipment

#### Armaments

##### Firearms

The firearms that are available to the swashbuckler are fairly obvious: with
their base DEX permanently stuck at exactly 20, the swashbuckler has no choice
but to favor armaments with no DEX requirements (or low DEX requirements). The
breakdown, by character level, looks vaguely like this (note that, of course,
you can always skip certain weapons, or acquire them later on):

|        level | armaments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -----------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  10&ndash;14 | Just use the Pistol (or Beginner Pirate&rsquo;s Pistol, or whatever it is that Kyrin may give you).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|  15&ndash;19 | If you&rsquo;re really starved for DEX gear, you can switch to the Dellinger Special here; it only requires &ge;5 DEX from equipment. But do note that it&rsquo;s speed 6, and thus slower than the Pistol (which is speed 5; it&rsquo;s also slower than the next-higher-level gun, The Negotiator, which is also speed 5).                                                                         |
|  20&ndash;24 | The Negotiator is a good place to make your first gun upgrade. It&rsquo;s speed 5, and only requires &ge;15 DEX from equipment. To equip the next gun (the speed 6 Golden Hook), this DEX requirement shoots up to &ge;30 DEX from equipment.                                                                                                                                                        |
|  25&ndash;34 | Personally, my first gun upgrade was to the Golden Hook; it is unfortunately speed 6, but it was the best gun that I could equip with my DEX gear (it requires &ge;30 DEX from equipment). It may be possible to equip the Cold Mind (and if you can, you should; it should last for a while), but at that point you&rsquo;re trying to squeeze &ge;50 DEX out of your equipment at level 30&hellip; |
|  35&ndash;42 | Finally, a maple weapon. The Maple Gun is strictly better than the ordinary level 35 gun, which is 1 speed category slower, and doesn&rsquo;t grant any AVOID. At this point, I was still using my (well-scrolled) Golden Hook.                                                                                                                                                                      |
|  43&ndash;63 | Here we have the next maple weapon: the Maple Storm Pistol. Again, very solid weapon, but at this point, I was&hellip; _still_ using my (well-scrolled) Golden Hook.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 64&ndash;200 | The end of the line. If you are fortunate enough to be playing on an implementation that has the full set of 2008 GMS Three Year Anniversary Event maple weapons, then you can make a considerable upgrade at this level: the Maple Canon Shooter. This is the ideal endgame firearm for swashbucklers.                                                                                              |

##### Melee

Because gunslingers/outlaws/corsairs are not designed to be melee jobs, the
choice of melee armaments for swashbucklers looks fairly similar to that for
permabeginners. However, swashbucklers have Somersault Kick. **Somersault Kick
always &ldquo;stabs&rdquo; with the weapon that you have equipped.** As a
result, you will want to **avoid** any of the following types of weapons,
unless you have no choice:

- Polearms.
- Axes (one-handed or two-handed, although you only have access to one-handed
  ones anyways).
- Blunt weapons (one-handed or two-handed).
- Wands &amp; staves (heh).

Losing out on polearms and blunt weapons is certainly distressing, but never
fear. You can still make efficient use of:

- Spears.
- Swords (one-handed or two-handed).
- Daggers.

The star of the show here is the spear: stabbing with a spear grants the
highest PSM (primary stat multiplier) in the game (tied with swinging with a
polearm), 5.0. But swords and daggers are nothing to sneeze at, either. Daggers
and one-handed swords get you a PSM of 4.0, and two-handed swords get you a PSM
of a whopping 4.6. And daggers &amp; one-handed swords are particularly
formidable when paired with a shield that gives solid WATK/STR. The strength of
daggers and swords is often in their attack speed; faster attack speeds make
Somersault Kick much more efficient and pleasant to use. Here&rsquo;s a little
weapon speed category cheatsheet (note that the names are ambiguous!):

| speed | name   |
| ----: | :----- |
|     2 | Faster |
|     3 | Faster |
|     4 | Fast   |
|     5 | Fast   |
|     6 | Normal |
|     7 | Slow   |
|     8 | Slow   |
|     9 | Slower |

The following table compares some of the swashbuckler&rsquo;s juiciest melee
weapons (&ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; methods of availability &mdash; that is, NPCs,
(party) quests, monster drops, and crafting &mdash; are bolded):

| level | name                  | type     | speed | WATK | other stats                  | availability                    | notes                                                                                                                                                       |

#### Shields

A gunslinger? Wearing a shield? Blasphemy! But with swashbucklers, anything is
possible. When engaging in melee and using a one-handed weapon, you will, of
course, want a shield. As usual, the Maple Shield is the most powerful, simply
because it has three extra slots, and you&rsquo;ll be wanting to scroll for
WATK (and/or STR). More accessible are the Stolen Fence (available from an NPC
and as a monster drop) and the Pan Lid (available as a reasonably common
monster drop). The Palette sports better defense than the Stolen Fence or Pan
Lid, and the LUK that it grants is useful for the accuracy (and avoidability).
My preference is the Stone Shield, if the implementation even has it, due to
its superior defense. The Black Phoenix Shield (again, if the implementation
even has it) is superior to either the Stolen Fence or the Pan Lid, and has
twice as much MDEF (and WDEF) as the Maple Shield.

#### Headgear

Swashbucklers, unfortunately, do not have access to very much of the
pirate-specific headgear. There is, however, one notable exception: if you are
fortunate enough to be playing on an implementation that has the extended
first-job quests (in the pirate&rsquo;s case, culminating in a battle with the
Crocell boss monster), you can (and must!) obtain the level 18 Crocell Hat.
This hat is so powerful as to almost be comparable to a Zakum Helmet.

If you cannot obtain the Crocell Hat, you still have some good options
(&ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; methods of availability &mdash; that is, NPCs, (party)
quests, monster drops, and crafting &mdash; are bolded):

more accessible, as Zakum tends to be run fairly often in most implementations,
and only requires level 50 (instead of the level 80 of Scar/Tar hats). Scar/Tar
hats aren&rsquo;t really better than Zakum Helmets, although it depends on what
you want to optimize for; obviously, the ideal Scar/Tar hat for a swashbuckler
is generally a Scarlion Hat (DEX).

When it comes to scrolling headgear, obviously you ideally want to scroll for
DEX, but scrolling for ACC is similarly good, and even 10%/30% DEF scrolls can
give a +1 ACC, which could be nice. Scrolling for HP is also viable for obvious
reasons. All-stat hats can be effectively Chaos Scrolled, if you&rsquo;re
feeling really saucy, or somehow have a large supply of Chaos Scrolls.

#### Clothing

Again, like with headgear, woodsmen unfortunately largely lack access to
bowman-specific attire of this kind (tops, bottoms, and overalls). This, again,
puts the woodsman in a similar situation as their permabeginner counterparts.
The idea here is to scroll an overall for DEX &mdash; unfortunately, tops
cannot be scrolled for DEX, although you _could_ go the unusual-but-viable
route of scrolling a bottom for DEX and scrolling a top for STR, or similar.
This leaves you with essentially two options: bathrobes, and sauna robes.

Bathrobes:

- Are able to be purchased from an NPC, and thus highly available for scrolling.
- Have a lower level requirement (20 &lt; 30).
- Give a nice SPEED boost (+10 SPEED), but are defensively inferior (+20 WDEF
  &lt; +30 WDEF; +0 AVOID &lt; +10 AVOID).

Sauna robes, on the other hand:

- Are more difficult to acquire, since you have to do a rather difficult quest
  (and one that has a minimum level requirement of 30) just to get one.
- Have a higher level requirement (30 &gt; 20).
- Are defensively superior (+30 WDEF &gt; +20 WDEF; +10 AVOID &gt; +0 AVOID),
  but do not grant any SPEED.

The fact that bathrobes can be purchased from an NPC makes them, by and large,
the clear favorite, since we really care about the scrolling outcome, not the
base stats of the armour.

#### Footwear

Again, not much bowman-specific footwear here, unless you have access to
Amdusias Shoes, in which case, just use those. The plan here is to scroll for
DEX (unless you end up with Facestompers, in which case you might(&#x203d;) try
Chaos Scrolling before scrolling for DEX).

The usual suspects here are:

| level | name                  | availability      | notable stats                                  | notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

|    30 | Green Snowshoes       | **NPC**           | 7 slots, +5 MDEF                               | The only footwear in this table that has any job requirements. The idea here is to make use of the two extra slots to get even more DEX from scrolling. The availability from an NPC for just 29k mesos makes this really possible.                                                                                                    |

Implementations vary widely on whether or not these are obtainable, and if so, how you get them, but in GMS, these were craftable (but not easily, of course!). |
|    80 | Violet Snowshoes      | rare drop         | 7 slots, +5 JUMP, +5 SPEED, +20 MDEF, +50 WDEF | Mostly known for having 7 slots (instead of 5), these also have pretty decent stats. Good luck getting a pair from The Boss!                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

#### Gloves

Again, no access to bowman-specific gloves. Generally, there are two kinds of
gloves that you might want: gloves scrolled for WATK, and gloves scrolled for
DEX/ACC. The usual suspects here are obvious: various colors of Work Gloves,
Green Mittens, various colors of Markers, &amp;c. Scrolling for WATK is ideal,
although scrolling for DEX/ACC can be useful when you are having accuracy
troubles and/or troubles getting enough DEX to equip something.

#### Capes

Not much to say here, since capes work essentially the same, regardless of
build. The ideal here is a pink cape that is Chaos Scrolled for WATK and/or
scrolled for DEX.

#### Earrings

You will, predictably, want to scroll your earrings for DEX. To this end,
earrings that can be purchased from NPCs (and possibly others that are
similarly easy to farm) are likely going to be what you end up with. However,
there are some earrings that come with stats (particularly, DEX) right out of
the box:

| level | name                                          | availability    | notable stats            | notes                                                                                                                                           |
| ----: | :-------------------------------------------- | :-------------- | :----------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    45 | Piercing of the Free Spirit                   | **quest**       | +1 all-stat, 4 slots     | May be available if your implementation has all of the Kerning Square quests implemented. Unfortunately only 4 slots (rather than the usual 5). |
|    50 | Altaire Earrings; Glittering Altaire Earrings | **party quest** | +1 all-stat; +2 all-stat | May be available as a reward for Ellin Party Quest.                                                                                             |
|    80 | Gold Emerald Earrings                         | rare drop       | +2 DEX                   | Dropped by The Boss. Good luck getting a pair. Also gives +5 INT.                                                                               |

#### Eyewear

We&rsquo;re mostly looking for DEX and ACC here. Eyewear can be scrolled for
ACC (and 10%/30% scrolls for eyewear for ACC will give +1 DEX on success).
Eyewear is the same for all jobs, essentially, but of particular note here are
Broken Glasses (+1 all-stat, available from LPQ) and Spectrum Goggles (+1 STR,
+1 DEX, gachapon-only).

#### Facewear

Again, mostly looking for DEX and ACC. Facewear is easier to scroll for DEX
than Eyewear, simply because scrolls for facewear for AVOID will give DEX on
success, even in the case of 60%/70% scrolls (as opposed to only giving DEX on
the success of 10%/30% scrolls). Of particular note are Sad Masks, which give
an average of +10 ACC out of the box. There are also various other face
accessories that may or may not be available, depending on your implementation,
and the ones that you&rsquo;ll want are generally any that give WATK and/or DEX
and/or STR and/or ACC right out of the box. However, anything with slots can be
scrolled with AVOID scrolls.

### Other items

#### Potions/food/drinks

As a woodsman, you want all of the WATK that you can get. To this end, you will
probably want potions/food/drinks that give WATK buffs. This is true regardless
of whether you are engaging in melee, or in archery, particularly because your
expected damage capabilities in both of these areas are going to be subpar when
compared to ordinary (non-odd) jobs specialized in these areas (warriors and
archers, respectively). Being smart with how you acquire and use WATK buffs can
help to narrow this gap. For WATK buffs that are available from NPCs
(&ldquo;WATK&sdot;s/meso&rdquo; is the magnitude of the WATK buff given,
multiplied by the duration, divided by the price per unit, and
&ldquo;meso/s&rdquo; is the cost of one second of the buff):

| name                    | WATK | WATK&sdot;s/meso | meso/s | duration | meso/unit | available from                                                                                                                                                                                              | notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Also, be warned that these only allow up to 3 per stack, so they use up inventory space very inefficiently. |

The items here are in ascending order of WATK, breaking any ties by sorting in
ascending order of WATK&sdot;s/meso. The two stand-out items here (in the
absence of Coke Town) are the Warrior Pill and the Cider. Both are tied for
first place w.r.t. WATK&sdot;s/meso, with the Warrior Pill being the low-cost
but low-WATK alternative to the higher-cost but higher-WATK Cider. This makes
Ciders great for doing big damage without breaking the bank or running into
scarcity (as you might with items that give WATK buffs greater than +20), and
Warrior Pills great for a WATK buff that you can have on at all times for a
very low meso cost (just 0.833 meso/s!).

With Coke Town, Ciders are still useful (they are still the largest WATK buff),
but Coke Pills are then firmly in first place with respect to WATK&sdot;s/meso,
and Coke Zero Pills become very viable as well, due to being the largest WATK
buff that is _inventory-space efficient_. Ciders are burdened by only stacking
up to 3 per inventory slot<sup>\[1\]</sup> (they are **not** burdened by the
&minus;5 ACC debuff, because that is easily cancelled out); as a result, if you
want the highest store-bought WATK buff possible, _and_ you haven&rsquo;t the
inventory space for Ciders, Coke Zero Pills are your best bet &mdash; or
Warrior Elixirs, in the absence of Coke Town. Other entries here (besides
Ciders, Coke Pills, Coke Lite Pills, Coke Zero Pills, Warrior Pills, and
Warrior Elixirs) are either not useful, or are situationally useful when you
happen to be near an NPC that sells them.

Also of note are accuracy potions/food/drinks. For woodsmen that are doing more
of the &ldquo;melee specialised&rdquo; kind of build (see above), these are not
really of much concern, since you get access to useful levels of the Focus
skill relatively early on. For other woodsmen, I recommend the use of Sniper
Pills (+10 WACC for 10 minutes, available for 500 mesos a pop in Ludibrium)
until you get Focus to at least level 10. Of course, you only have to use these
on an as-needed basis.

vary; the &ldquo;3&rdquo; figure used here is based on MapleLegends.

#### Ammunition

Like potions/food/drinks that give WATK buffs, ammunitions that give WATK buffs
are a useful way to eke out a few extra WATK, whenever you are engaging in
archery. Particularly, the cheapest kind are bronzed ammunition, which grant +1
WATK and can be purchased from various NPCs (in the Aquarium, Ludibrium, KFT,
Leafre, and the Omega Sector) for 10 mesos per unit (20k mesos for a ream of 2k
units)<sup>\[1\]</sup>. More beneficial are colored ammunition (red for arrows,
blue for quarrels), which grant a whopping +4 WATK, and can be purchased in
Showa Town for 40 mesos per unit (80k mesos for a ream of 2k
units)<sup>\[2\]</sup>; diamond ammunition grants the same bonus for half the
price<sup>\[3\]</sup>, although diamond ammunition can only be purchased by
those who are allies of the Raven Ninja Clan.

Note that although we are using two thousand as a &ldquo;ream&rdquo; here
&mdash; because that is the size of a stack of normal arrows<sup>\[4\]</sup>
&mdash; bronzed ammunition stacks up to 1.8k per slot<sup>\[4\]</sup>, and
colored ammunition up to 1k<sup>\[4\]</sup>. Also note that when Soul Arrow is
active, you cannot benefit from any special ammunition.

MapleLegends-specific note: Diamond ammunition is actually superior to coloured
ammunition in MapleLegends, granting 5 WATK instead of 4. If possible, I
recommend getting access to [Mo&rsquo;s
store](https://bbb.hidden-street.net/npc/mo) (i.e. becoming an ally of the
Raven Ninja Clan); he sells Ciders, diamond ammunition, All Cure Potions,
Return to New Leaf City Scrolls, and some other possibly useful stuff.
MapleLegends also tweaked prices to be generally cheaper for arrows and
quarrels, and made them stack more readily per-slot. So you have little excuse
to use Soul Arrow in MapleLegends!
