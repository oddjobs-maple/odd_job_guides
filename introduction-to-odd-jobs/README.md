# Introduction To Odd Jobs

In MapleStory, every character is built in a certain way. The player must
decide what job advancements to take, how to allocate their AP, how to allocate
their SP, and what equipment to use in combat. The player is free to do as they
wish, so long as they don’t violate any of the game’s rules. Nevertheless, the
game naturally encourages players to make their choices in one of a handful of
narrow ways.

In spite of the game’s encouragement, players of MapleStory have always found
creative and interesting ways to violate these norms. In many cases, these
violations have their own kind of structure — a certain logic to them. So much
so, that we often think of these strange character builds as “jobs” in their
own right. These so-called “odd jobs” are the subject of this brief
introductory guide.

This guide gives a brief overview of some of the most essential and
commonly-played odd jobs. For a more detailed list, you can check out [the list
of odd jobs on the **Oddjobs**
website](https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/odd-jobs.html). This guide also doesn’t
cover any odd jobs that are unique to post-Big-Bang MapleStory.

## 🔰 Beginners

### Islander

![From left to right: an ordinary islander, a magelander](islanders.webp
"From left to right: an ordinary islander, a magelander")

Islanders, like most characters, leave the Training Camp. But they never leave
Maple Island! As a result, they are necessarily permabeginners, and they have a
very limited set of monsters that they can fight. DEX is perhaps the most
important stat for islanders, as it improves their minimum damage per hit, thus
bringing them closer to one-shotting the monsters of Maple Island.

Because Maple Island is totally isolated from the rest of the Maple World,
islanders have a very unique set of equipment & scrolls that they can use. As a
result, events are more important to islanders than they are to other
characters, because they offer the chance to obtain special items that don’t
occur naturally.

Although they may appear severely limited at first glance, dedicated islanders
are capable of achieving impressive levels. They also come in many flavours!:

#### Subspecies

- **Magelander:** Exclusively uses the Metal Wand, and mostly fights by using
  the Three Snails skill.
- **DEXlander:** Has high DEX.
- **STRlander:** Has high STR.
- **LUKlander:** Has high LUK, and uses claws (e.g. the Magical Mitten).
- **Perfectlander:** Has enough STR, INT, & LUK to equip any weapon on the
  island (including the Leather Purse and the Metal Wand).
- **Hybridlander:** Is a hybrid of two or more of the above. STR/DEX and
  DEX/LUK hybrids are particularly common.

### Camper

![From left to right: a classic camper, an applelander](campers.webp
"From left to right: a classic camper, an applelander")

Campers are, like islanders, restricted by their location. But unlike
islanders, they never make it out of the Training Camp! Campers are thus
_extremely_ restricted: they never gain equipment, and they are forced to only
fight monsters that give 1 EXP each. Most campers choose the Sword, as it has
the fastest attack speed out of the three starter weapons.

There may be different flavours of camper, depending on the version of
MapleStory:

#### Subspecies

- **Classic camper:** Exists in an older version, where the camp is outdoors
  and features Tutorial Jr. Sentinels.
- **Applelander:** Is an Adventurer camper in a newer version, where the camp
  is indoors, forces the player to wear a green apple suit, and features
  Tutorial Leatties and Tutorial Drumming Rabbits.
- **Roadie:** Is a Cygnus Knight camper, who trains along Empress’ Road. This
  is the subspecies that is most similar to an islander, as the monsters there
  do drop a few items.
- **Snowlander:** Is an Aran camper, who fights only Tutorial Murus.

### Permabeginner (outland)

![From left to right: a STRginner, a wandginner, a DEXginner, and a
besinner](outland-permabeginners.webp
"From left to right: a STRginner, a wandginner, a DEXginner, and a besinner")

While both islanders and campers are necessarily permabeginners, the term
“permabeginner” is often used narrowly to refer to _outland_ permabeginners.
Outland permabeginners have a whole Maple World to explore, but their arsenal
remains much the same as their inland counterparts: pretty much just
basic-attacking.

Because they have access to more dangerous terrain, outland permabeginners care
more about their _average_ damage per hit than inland permabeginners do, and
can reach greater heights! But with the dangerous terrain, comes the
realisation that beginners are strong at heart, but maybe not in body.
Permabeginners have exceptionally poor MAXHP (although they benefit more from
WDEF than other classes do), and basic-attacking eventually becomes too weak to
competently fight monsters of the permabeginner’s own level.

That being said, outland permabeginners are a perennially popular choice of
main character for the odd-minded! Most focus on STR (sometimes with DEX added,
to improve WACC), and tend to use polearms, swords, and daggers. Nevertheless,
outland permabeginners are at least as diverse as their inland counterparts.

Depending on the version of MapleStory, outland permabeginners may have access
to special beginner-only weapons, like the level 20 Frozen Tuna, the Sake
Bottle, and the almighty Maroon Mop.

#### Subspecies

- **STRginner:** Focuses on STR. This is the most common subspecies.
- **Besinner/LUKginner:** Focuses on LUK, and uses claws (e.g. the Magical
  Mitten).
- **DEXginner:** Is pure DEX.
- **Wandginner:** Exclusively uses wands as their weapons.

## ⚔️ Warriors

### Permawarrior

![Two permawarriors](permawarriors.webp "Two permawarriors")

Permawarriors (a.k.a. permasword(wo)men) are one of five kinds of
perma-first-jobbers (“perma-firsts”). Permawarriors take first job advancement
to warrior/sword(wo)man, but never job advance beyond this point. This makes
perma-firsts similar to permabeginners, in that they are defined by their
refusal to job advance.

Permawarriors rely on Power Strike & Slash Blast for offence, and Improved
MaxHP Increase & Iron Body for defence. This makes them quite versatile,
although they are sluggish due to a lack of mobility skills and ranged attacks.

Perhaps the most notable aspect of the permawarrior is the sheer variety of
equipment that they are capable of using. Not only do they get full access to
warrior-only equipment like ordinary warriors do, but they are also much less
picky when it comes to weapon types. Polearms, swords, axes, blunt weapons, and
even daggers are all very viable weapons for the permawarrior!

### HP warrior

![Two HP warriors, using Rage and Power
Guard](hp-warriors.webp "Two HP warriors, using Rage and Power Guard")

HP warriors (a.k.a. blood warriors) are statless warriors who put all of their
AP into MAXHP. An HP warrior only adds enough STR to job advance, and then
waits until they have Improved MaxHP Increase maxed before dumping all of their
AP into MAXHP. This makes HP warriors _incredibly_ durable — they may hit the
30k MAXHP cap at around level 90–100!

The main tool in the HP warrior’s arsenal is typically Power Guard. Every time
that the HP warrior touches a foe, a portion of the damage that they take is
removed from their foe’s HP. This is often inefficient, but means that HP
warriors can fight just about _any_ enemy by the time that they are level ≈41
or so! It also means that HP warriors typically go the fighter or page route
for second job advancement (spear(wo)men never get Power Guard). To maximise
their Power Guard damage, the HP warrior seeks to lower their WDEF as much as
possible — to that end, the debuff from Rage can be useful (in addition to
being useful for the party).

Rarely, HP warriors may go the spear(wo)man route in order to provide support
for their party while still at a low level, in the form of Hyper Body and Iron
Will.

### Dagger warrior

![From left to right: a dagger spearwoman, a dagger sader](dagger-warriors.webp
"From left to right: a dagger spearwoman, a dagger sader")

Warriors who exclusively use daggers as their weapons are known as dagger
warriors. “STR daggers” — daggers that require significant STR and DEX to be
equipped — are popular among ordinary bandits, but they are actually not
exclusive to thieves. They’re exclusive to thieves _and_ warriors! Because
these thief-warrior daggers _only_ require STR and DEX to be equipped (i.e. no
LUK required), they naturally encourage the creation of dagger warriors.

Like permawarriors, dagger warriors are essentially stuck with Power Strike &
Slash Blast for life. However, unlike permawarriors, dagger warriors can take
second job (and further job) advancements. This unlocks tons of useful goodies.
Most notably: Rage, Threaten, Hyper Body, Berserk, Shout, Shield Mastery, and
most of all, Combo Attack! This makes fighter → crusader → hero the natural
class progression for dagger warriors, although other paths have their
advantages as well. Note that Dragon Roar is not usable by dagger warriors.

When built “normally” — i.e. just enough DEX to equip one’s weapon, and the
remaining AP into STR — dagger warriors are amongst the most powerful odd jobs,
in terms of sheer DPS output.

#### Related species

- **Wand warrior:** Exclusively uses wands, instead of daggers.

### DEX warrior

![From left to right: a DEXadin, a darksterity knight](dex-warriors.webp
"From left to right: a DEXadin, a darksterity knight")

Warriors who dump all of their AP (except for the 35 base STR necessary to job
advance) into DEX are known as DEX warriors. Although DEX warriors deal
considerably less damage than their non-odd counterparts, they are typically
capable of using the same skillset, and their extreme agility comes with its
own perks.

DEX warriors are renowned for their godlike accuracy and incredibly stable
damage output. They also have much more avoidability than STR-based warriors,
and have no issues wielding the legendary Stonetooth Sword. And DEX _does_
contribute to the magnitude of the warrior’s damage — this, combined with the
arsenals provided by the various warrior classes, makes DEX warriors some of
the most high-powered odd jobs overall.

Because of their STRlessness, DEX warriors have unique equipment
considerations. This often results in DEX warrior gear looking more like
permabeginner gear than ordinary warrior gear.

#### Related species

- **LUK warrior:** Is pure LUK, instead of pure DEX. LUK warriors give up some
  damage, damage stability, and WACC, in exchange for more avoidability, and
  higher DPS with claws.
