# Introduction To Odd Jobs

In MapleStory, every character is built in a certain way. The player must
decide what job advancements to take, how to allocate their AP, how to allocate
their SP, and what equipment to use in combat. The player is free to do as they
wish, so long as they don’t violate any of the game’s rules. Nevertheless, the
game naturally encourages players to make their choices in one of a handful of
narrow ways.

In spite of the game’s encouragement, players of MapleStory have always found
creative and interesting ways to violate these norms. In many cases, these
violations have their own kind of structure — a certain logic to them. So much
so, that we often think of these strange character builds as “jobs” in their
own right. These so-called “odd jobs” are the subject of this brief
introductory guide.

This guide gives a brief overview of some of the most essential and
commonly-played odd jobs. For a more detailed list, you can check out [the list
of odd jobs on the **Oddjobs**
website](https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/odd-jobs.html). This guide also doesn’t
cover any odd jobs that are unique to post-Big-Bang MapleStory.

### Islander

"From left to right: an ordinary islander, a magelander")

Islanders, like most characters, leave the Training Camp. But they never leave
Maple Island! As a result, they are necessarily permabeginners, and they have a
very limited set of monsters that they can fight. DEX is perhaps the most
important stat for islanders, as it improves their minimum damage per hit, thus
bringing them closer to one-shotting the monsters of Maple Island.

Because Maple Island is totally isolated from the rest of the Maple World,
islanders have a very unique set of equipment & scrolls that they can use. As a
result, events are more important to islanders than they are to other
characters, because they offer the chance to obtain special items that don’t
occur naturally.

Although they may appear severely limited at first glance, dedicated islanders
are capable of achieving impressive levels. They also come in many flavours!:

#### Subspecies

- **Magelander:** Exclusively uses the Metal Wand, and mostly fights by using
  the Three Snails skill.
- **DEXlander:** Has high DEX.
- **STRlander:** Has high STR.
- **LUKlander:** Has high LUK, and uses claws (e.g. the Magical Mitten).
- **Perfectlander:** Has enough STR, INT, & LUK to equip any weapon on the
  island (including the Leather Purse and the Metal Wand).
- **Hybridlander:** Is a hybrid of two or more of the above. STR/DEX and
  DEX/LUK hybrids are particularly common.
