<blockquote>
War has many manifestations. It can make heroes of ordinary people. It can be
desperate and horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing instances
of excellence and courage. In either case, the gods of war watch over warriors
and reward them for their great deeds. The clerics of such gods excel in
battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence
as prayers.

The **STR cleric** is an odd job/odd build in MapleStory that represents just
one of the three possible specializations of STR mages, the other two being the
ice/lightning STR mage, and the fire/poison STR mage. STR clerics are of
particular interest because the niche of ordinary clerics/priests/bishops is
largely in the realm of &ldquo;utility&rdquo;, which is something that STR
mages can usually perform just as well at, while still dedicating all of their
might to melee combat. Furthermore, STR clerics embody the archetype of the
divinely blessed knight-errant: while they may be ordinary mortal combatants in
the melee, they are both well-trained in this mode of combat, as well as graced
with divine powers granted to them by their deit(y/ies) that can be used to
heal, to aid, and occasionally even to harm. It is this potent combination of a
knight&rsquo;s skill with the indispensable ritualistic powers of a priest that
makes the STR cleric both an enviable ally, as well as a formidable opponent.

## A quick note on the name

This job is referred to throughout this document as &ldquo;STR cleric&rdquo;
(plural &ldquo;STR clerics&rdquo;). This job is also commonly referred to by
various other names:

- Battle priest
- \[nonspecifically:\] Battle mage
- Battle cleric
- Battle bishop
- \[nonspecifically:\] STR mage
- \[nonspecifically:\] STR magician
- STR priest
- STR bishop

## Pros and cons

Discussing the pros and cons of the STR cleric as a job can only be done with
the understanding that the STR cleric _is an odd job_, and is therefore
inherently suboptimal in many ways (if it weren&rsquo;t, we would be very lucky
indeed to be able to call it an &ldquo;odd&rdquo;, or &ldquo;unusual&rdquo;,
job).

Pros:

- Ability to effectively engage in melee combat while also having the powers of
  a magician/cleric.
- _Incredible_ levels of utility as an odd job, considering that most odd jobs
  tend to lack a good utility skillset (or, may lack skills entirely or almost
  entirely&hellip;).
- Very sturdy; on top of all mages having access to Magic Guard and Magic
  Armor, clerics/priests/bishops are naturally the sturdiest mages, due to
  having skills like Invincible, Bless, Heal, Elemental Resistance, Dispel,
  &amp;c.
- Ability to use Teleport as a melee job.
- Doom is still an effective debuff skill, even with very low INT and LUK.
- ***BATTLE PRIEST!!***

Cons:

- Your skills that do magical damage (Magic Claw, Holy Arrow, Summon Dragon,
  Shining Ray, &amp;c.) are effectively useless due to being INTless and
  LUKless. Heal is only useful defensively, as its ability to deal magical
  damage is also useless.
- Considerably worse accuracy in comparison to an ordinary mage, and even in
  comparison to an ordinary warrior, due to the fact that you gain less ACC per
  point of DEX than warriors do.
- Unfortunately not as good at melee combat as some other jobs are
  (particularly non-odd jobs, i.e. ordinary/mainstream jobs). Given the same
  equipment, any ordinary warrior, bandit, or brawler build that could be
  considered &ldquo;standard&rdquo; or &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; in any way will
  be able to outperform you in melee from at least second job onwards, and
  likely earlier as well.
