<blockquote>
War has many manifestations. It can make heroes of ordinary people. It can be
desperate and horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing instances
of excellence and courage. In either case, the gods of war watch over warriors
and reward them for their great deeds. The clerics of such gods excel in
battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence
as prayers.

The **STR cleric** is an odd job/odd build in MapleStory that represents just
one of the three possible specializations of STR mages, the other two being the
ice/lightning STR mage, and the fire/poison STR mage. STR clerics are of
particular interest because the niche of ordinary clerics/priests/bishops is
largely in the realm of &ldquo;utility&rdquo;, which is something that STR
mages can usually perform just as well at, while still dedicating all of their
might to melee combat. Furthermore, STR clerics embody the archetype of the
divinely blessed knight-errant: while they may be ordinary mortal combatants in
the melee, they are both well-trained in this mode of combat, as well as graced
with divine powers granted to them by their deit(y/ies) that can be used to
heal, to aid, and occasionally even to harm. It is this potent combination of a
knight&rsquo;s skill with the indispensable ritualistic powers of a priest that
makes the STR cleric both an enviable ally, as well as a formidable opponent.

## A quick note on the name

This job is referred to throughout this document as &ldquo;STR cleric&rdquo;
(plural &ldquo;STR clerics&rdquo;). This job is also commonly referred to by
various other names:

- Battle priest
- \[nonspecifically:\] Battle mage
- Battle cleric
- Battle bishop
- \[nonspecifically:\] STR mage
- \[nonspecifically:\] STR magician
- STR priest
- STR bishop

## Pros and cons

Discussing the pros and cons of the STR cleric as a job can only be done with
the understanding that the STR cleric _is an odd job_, and is therefore
inherently suboptimal in many ways (if it weren&rsquo;t, we would be very lucky
indeed to be able to call it an &ldquo;odd&rdquo;, or &ldquo;unusual&rdquo;,
job).

Pros:

- Ability to effectively engage in melee combat while also having the powers of
  a magician/cleric.
- _Incredible_ levels of utility as an odd job, considering that most odd jobs
  tend to lack a good utility skillset (or, may lack skills entirely or almost
  entirely&hellip;).
- Very sturdy; on top of all mages having access to Magic Guard and Magic
  Armor, clerics/priests/bishops are naturally the sturdiest mages, due to
  having skills like Invincible, Bless, Heal, Elemental Resistance, Dispel,
  &amp;c.
- Ability to use Teleport as a melee job.
- Doom is still an effective debuff skill, even with very low INT and LUK.
- **_BATTLE PRIEST!!_**

Cons:

- Your skills that do magical damage (Magic Claw, Holy Arrow, Summon Dragon,
  Shining Ray, &amp;c.) are effectively useless due to being INTless and
  LUKless. Heal is only useful defensively, as its ability to deal magical
  damage is also useless.
- Considerably worse accuracy in comparison to an ordinary mage, and even in
  comparison to an ordinary warrior, due to the fact that you gain less ACC per
  point of DEX than warriors do.
- Unfortunately not as good at melee combat as some other jobs are
  (particularly non-odd jobs, i.e. ordinary/mainstream jobs). Given the same
  equipment, any ordinary warrior, bandit, or brawler build that could be
  considered &ldquo;standard&rdquo; or &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; in any way will
  be able to outperform you in melee from at least second job onwards, and
  likely earlier as well.

## AP build

STR clerics are defined, in part, by having a base (that is, not including
bonuses from equipment or buffs) INT of exactly 20, and having a base LUK of
exactly 4. _Technically_, as long as you satisfy these constraints, any AP
build is valid. However, in general, you want to otherwise use your APs like a
warrior would &mdash; or better, like a permabeginner would. Generally, you
want to keep your DEX as low as possible and pump everything into STR. You
might need some DEX though &mdash; depending on your equipment and on what
monsters you are fighting &mdash; in order to reduce MISS chances (ideally to
0%, although it&rsquo;s possible to just put up with small-but-nonzero MISS
chances).

## Skill builds

Skill builds can be flexible here, in part because your ability to deal damage
is usually unrelated to your skills. I&rsquo;ve split the builds into two
similar paths: the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; build, and the &ldquo;permadeath&rdquo;
build, so called because it focuses on raising defenses as high as possible, as
early as possible.

</details>

SP allocation for first job is pretty straightforward: we need ot max Improved
MaxMP Increase ASAP, especially considering that we are INTless and thus need
all of the MaxMP that we can get. Then we quickly get Magic Guard to level 13,
at which point 55% of incoming damage is taken out of our MP (and 45% out of
our HP). We stop there because at this point, we don&rsquo;t have much MaxMP to
use Magic Guard with anyways, and also Magic Armor is just better defense at
this level. So we quickly max Magic Armor, and then go back and max Magic
Guard. Then we have leftover SPs; we can use these to max out the cost-saving
passive skill, Improved MP Recovery. Then at level 30 we have one SP left over
that we have to spend, and have literally no choice but to use it for Energy
Bolt (a useless skill).

The basic idea here is to put our first SP into Teleport in order to have it,
and then immediately rush max Bless. Bless gives us MDEF, AVOID, and most
importantly: precious, precious ACC. Then, we leave Invincible at level 5
(it&rsquo;s reasonably effective even at that level, at least for now) in order
to focus on maxing Heal; Heal really needs to be maxed, because being INTless
and LUKless means that our Heal needs all of the help that it can get. Remember
that Heal is only useful defensively as a STR cleric, as the magic damage will
always MISS undead monsters. Now we can finally max Invincible and Teleport,
and after that we have nothing left to spend SPs on.

</details>

The main difference here is that we max Invincible first, even before Bless.
Invincible is by far the most important defensive skill here, although Bless
helps as well. Heal helps too, but not as much as Invincible or even Bless at
this level. Plus, Bless gives ACC.

The build here is pretty straightforward, with an early single SP into both
Mystic Door and Elemental Resistance, because both skills are useful even at
level 1. We prioritise Doom over Dispel and Mystic Door (although of course,
Dispel in Mystic Door are both maxed and also get a few SPs early on), mostly
because we will be meleeing mobs one by one. Doom helps to slow your enemies
down, and also take away their fancy attacks so that they cannot use those
fancy attacks to knock you back. Of course, you don&rsquo;t _have_ to
prioritise Doom in this way, since of course Dispel and Mystic Door may
potentially be more useful to you (particularly if you are bossing early on).

The main difference here (of the permadeath version) is that we max Elemental
Resistance before getting Holy Symbol. We also get an early point in Doom, in
case it happens to be useful defensively. This build is less advisable than the
permadeath version of the cleric skill build, just because it puts off Holy
Symbol in order to get a skill that is a good defensive skill, but perhaps a
tad too situational to justify delaying Holy Symbol.
