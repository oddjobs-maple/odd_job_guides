War has many manifestations. It can make heroes of ordinary people. It can be
desperate and horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing instances
of excellence and courage. In either case, the gods of war watch over warriors
and reward them for their great deeds. The clerics of such gods excel in
battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence
as prayers.

The **STR cleric** is an odd job/odd build in MapleStory that represents just
one of the three possible specializations of STR mages, the other two being the
ice/lightning STR mage, and the fire/poison STR mage. STR clerics are of
particular interest because the niche of ordinary clerics/priests/bishops is
largely in the realm of &ldquo;utility&rdquo;, which is something that STR
mages can usually perform just as well at, while still dedicating all of their
might to melee combat. Furthermore, STR clerics embody the archetype of the
divinely blessed knight-errant: while they may be ordinary mortal combatants in
the melee, they are both well-trained in this mode of combat, as well as graced
with divine powers granted to them by their deit(y/ies) that can be used to
heal, to aid, and occasionally even to harm. It is this potent combination of a
knight&rsquo;s skill with the indispensable ritualistic powers of a priest that
makes the STR cleric both an enviable ally, as well as a formidable opponent.

## A quick note on the name

This job is referred to throughout this document as &ldquo;STR cleric&rdquo;
(plural &ldquo;STR clerics&rdquo;). This job is also commonly referred to by
various other names:

- Battle priest
- \[nonspecifically:\] Battle mage
- Battle cleric
- Battle bishop
- \[nonspecifically:\] STR mage
- \[nonspecifically:\] STR magician
- STR priest
- STR bishop

## Pros and cons

Discussing the pros and cons of the STR cleric as a job can only be done with
the understanding that the STR cleric _is an odd job_, and is therefore
inherently suboptimal in many ways (if it weren&rsquo;t, we would be very lucky
indeed to be able to call it an &ldquo;odd&rdquo;, or &ldquo;unusual&rdquo;,
job).

Pros:

- Ability to effectively engage in melee combat while also having the powers of
  a magician/cleric.
- _Incredible_ levels of utility as an odd job, considering that most odd jobs
  tend to lack a good utility skillset (or, may lack skills entirely or almost
  entirely&hellip;).
- Very sturdy; on top of all mages having access to Magic Guard and Magic
  Armor, clerics/priests/bishops are naturally the sturdiest mages, due to
  having skills like Invincible, Bless, Heal, Elemental Resistance, Dispel,
  &amp;c.
- Ability to use Teleport as a melee job.
- Doom is still an effective debuff skill, even with very low INT and LUK.
- **_BATTLE PRIEST!!_**

Cons:

- Your skills that do magical damage (Magic Claw, Holy Arrow, Summon Dragon,
  Shining Ray, &amp;c.) are effectively useless due to being INTless and
  LUKless. Heal is only useful defensively, as its ability to deal magical
  damage is also useless.
- Considerably worse accuracy in comparison to an ordinary mage, and even in
  comparison to an ordinary warrior, due to the fact that you gain less ACC per
  point of DEX than warriors do.
- Unfortunately not as good at melee combat as some other jobs are
  (particularly non-odd jobs, i.e. ordinary/mainstream jobs). Given the same
  equipment, any ordinary warrior, bandit, or brawler build that could be
  considered &ldquo;standard&rdquo; or &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; in any way will
  be able to outperform you in melee from at least second job onwards, and
  likely earlier as well.

## AP build

STR clerics are defined, in part, by having a base (that is, not including
bonuses from equipment or buffs) INT of exactly 20, and having a base LUK of
exactly 4. _Technically_, as long as you satisfy these constraints, any AP
build is valid. However, in general, you want to otherwise use your APs like a
warrior would &mdash; or better, like a permabeginner would. Generally, you
want to keep your DEX as low as possible and pump everything into STR. You
might need some DEX though &mdash; depending on your equipment and on what
monsters you are fighting &mdash; in order to reduce MISS chances (ideally to
0%, although it&rsquo;s possible to just put up with small-but-nonzero MISS
chances).

Note that although STR is obviously your main stat, with DEX being secondary to
it, you _do_ benefit from INT and LUK as well.

INT:

- Increases the effectiveness of Heal.
- Increases MDEF.
- Increases MaxMP gain on level-up.

LUK:

- Increases ACC (albeit not as much as DEX does).
- Increases the effectiveness of Heal.
- Increases AVOID.

## Skill builds

Skill builds can be flexible here, in part because your ability to deal damage
is usually unrelated to your skills. I&rsquo;ve split the builds into two
similar paths: the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; build, and the &ldquo;permadeath&rdquo;
build, so called because it focuses on raising defenses as high as possible, as
early as possible.

</details>

SP allocation for first job is pretty straightforward: we need ot max Improved
MaxMP Increase ASAP, especially considering that we are INTless and thus need
all of the MaxMP that we can get. Then we quickly get Magic Guard to level 13,
at which point 55% of incoming damage is taken out of our MP (and 45% out of
our HP). We stop there because at this point, we don&rsquo;t have much MaxMP to
use Magic Guard with anyways, and also Magic Armor is just better defense at
this level. So we quickly max Magic Armor, and then go back and max Magic
Guard. Then we have leftover SPs; we can use these to max out the cost-saving
passive skill, Improved MP Recovery. Then at level 30 we have one SP left over
that we have to spend, and have literally no choice but to use it for Energy
Bolt (a useless skill).

The basic idea here is to put our first SP into Teleport in order to have it,
and then immediately rush max Bless. Bless gives us MDEF, AVOID, and most
importantly: precious, precious ACC. Then, we leave Invincible at level 5
(it&rsquo;s reasonably effective even at that level, at least for now) in order
to focus on maxing Heal; Heal really needs to be maxed, because being INTless
and LUKless means that our Heal needs all of the help that it can get. Remember
that Heal is only useful defensively as a STR cleric, as the magic damage will
always MISS undead monsters. Now we can finally max Invincible and Teleport,
and after that we have nothing left to spend SPs on.

</details>

The main difference here is that we max Invincible first, even before Bless.
Invincible is by far the most important defensive skill here, although Bless
helps as well. Heal helps too, but not as much as Invincible or even Bless at
this level. Plus, Bless gives ACC.

The build here is pretty straightforward, with an early single SP into both
Mystic Door and Elemental Resistance, because both skills are useful even at
level 1. We prioritise Doom over Dispel and Mystic Door (although of course,
Dispel in Mystic Door are both maxed and also get a few SPs early on), mostly
because we will be meleeing mobs one by one. Doom helps to slow your enemies
down, and also take away their fancy attacks so that they cannot use those
fancy attacks to knock you back. Of course, you don&rsquo;t _have_ to
prioritise Doom in this way, since of course Dispel and Mystic Door may
potentially be more useful to you (particularly if you are bossing early on).

The main difference here (of the permadeath version) is that we max Elemental
Resistance before getting Holy Symbol. We also get an early point in Doom, in
case it happens to be useful defensively. This build is less advisable than the
permadeath version of the cleric skill build, just because it puts off Holy
Symbol in order to get a skill that is a good defensive skill, but perhaps a
tad too situational to justify delaying Holy Symbol.

## Itemization

A STR cleric is nothing without her equipment and her gear&hellip;

### Equipment

#### Armaments

Because magicians/clerics/priests/&amp;c. are not designed to be melee jobs,
the choice of melee armaments for STR mages looks fairly similar to that for a
closely related odd job: the permabeginner. As such, this section will mostly
just highlight the _differences_ w.r.t. melee armaments for STR mages, as
compared to melee armaments for permabeginners.

STR mages obviously do not have access to any permabeginner-specific armaments;
this means no access to any of the following:

- The level 20 Frozen Tuna
- Sake Bottle
- Maroon Mop

STR mages do, however, have access to a small handful of armaments that
permabeginners do not have access to, although they are unfortunately limited
to low levels:

- Mace (level 15)
- Iron Mace (level 20)
- Fusion Mace (level 25)

Another difference for STR clerics in particular is that, unlike
permabeginners, they can benefit from weapons like e.g. the Flaming Katana,
which give both WATK _and_ MATK. The MATK helps to increase the effectiveness
of your Heal.

#### Shields

When engaging in melee and using a one-handed weapon, you will, of course, want
a shield. As usual, the Maple Shield is the most powerful, simply because it
has three extra slots, and you&rsquo;ll be wanting to scroll for WATK (and/or
STR). More accessible are the Stolen Fence (available from an NPC and as a
monster drop) and the Pan Lid (available as a reasonably common monster drop).
The Palette sports better defense than the Stolen Fence or Pan Lid, and the LUK
that it grants is quite useful. My preference is the Stone Shield, if the
implementation even has it, due to its superior defense. The Black Phoenix
Shield (again, if the implementation even has it) is superior to either the
Stolen Fence or the Pan Lid, and has twice as much MDEF (and WDEF) as the Maple
Shield.

Because you&rsquo;re a mage, you can use the Maple Magician Shield, a level 64
shield with good defenses, +2 INT, and most importantly, 10 slots. This is a
superior choice to the Maple Shield if you can manage to scroll it well. A
well-scrolled Maple Magician Shield is _the_ endgame shield for a
one-handed-fighting STR mage.

#### Headgear

STR mages, unfortunately, do not have access to any of the magician-specific
headgear. There is, however, one notable exception: if you are fortunate enough
to be playing on an implementation that has the extended first-job quests (in
the magician&rsquo;s case, culminating in a battle with the Marbas boss
monster), you should obtain the level 18 Marbas Hat. The good defenses and
accuracy are extremely nice, and the +12 INT helps too.

If you cannot obtain the Marbas Hat, or just want something that will increase
your DPS, you still have some good options (&ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; methods of
availability &mdash; that is, NPCs, (party) quests, monster drops, and crafting
&mdash; are bolded):

This brings us to the ideal end-game hats: Zakum Helmets, and
&ldquo;Scar/Tar&rdquo; (Scarlion and Targar) hats. These headgears are so
incredibly powerful that they need no introduction. Zakum Helmets are generally
more accessible, as Zakum tends to be run fairly often in most implementations,
and only requires level 50 (instead of the level 80 of Scar/Tar hats). Scar/Tar
hats aren&rsquo;t really better than Zakum Helmets, although it depends on what
you want to optimize for; obviously, the ideal Scar/Tar hat for a STR mage is
generally a Scarlion Hat (STR).

When it comes to scrolling headgear, obviously you ideally want to scroll for
DEX, but scrolling for ACC is similarly good, and even 10%/30% DEF scrolls can
give a +1 ACC, which could be nice. All-stat hats can be effectively Chaos
Scrolled, if you&rsquo;re feeling really saucy, or somehow have a large supply
of Chaos Scrolls.

#### Clothing

Again, like with headgear, STR mages unfortunately largely lack access to
magician-specific attire of this kind (tops, bottoms, and overalls). This,
again, puts the woodsman in a similar situation as their permabeginner
counterparts. The idea here is typically to scroll an overall for DEX and/or
STR &mdash; unfortunately, tops cannot be scrolled for DEX, although it is also
possible to go the route of scrolling a bottom for DEX and scrolling a top for
STR. If going the route of overalls, this leaves you with essentially two
options: bathrobes, and sauna robes.

Bathrobes:

- Are able to be purchased from an NPC, and thus highly available for scrolling.
- Have a lower level requirement (20 &lt; 30).
- Give a nice SPEED boost (+10 SPEED), but are defensively inferior (+20 WDEF
  &lt; +30 WDEF; +0 AVOID &lt; +10 AVOID).

Sauna robes, on the other hand:

- Are more difficult to acquire, since you have to do a rather difficult quest
  (and one that has a minimum level requirement of 30) just to get one.
- Have a higher level requirement (30 &gt; 20).
- Are defensively superior (+30 WDEF &gt; +20 WDEF; +10 AVOID &gt; +0 AVOID),
  but do not grant any SPEED.

The fact that bathrobes can be purchased from an NPC makes them, by and large,
the clear favorite, since we really care about the scrolling outcome, not the
base stats of the armour.

#### Footwear

Again, not much magician-specific footwear here, unless you have access to
Marbas Shoes, in which case, just use those. The plan here is to scroll for
DEX (unless you end up with Facestompers, in which case you might(&#x203d;) try
Chaos Scrolling before scrolling for DEX).

The usual suspects here are:

| level | name                  | availability      | notable stats                                  | notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

#### Gloves

Again, no access to magician-specific gloves. Generally, there are two kinds of
gloves that you might want: gloves scrolled for WATK, and gloves scrolled for
DEX/ACC. The usual suspects here are obvious: various colors of Work Gloves,
Green Mittens, various colors of Markers, &amp;c. Scrolling for WATK is
obviously _ideal_, although scrolling for DEX/ACC is very useful when you are
having accuracy troubles.

Notable, however, is the fact that STR clerics are the only job besides gishes
that can make full use of Flamekeeper Cordons. The ACC is extremely helpful,
and the MATK helps make your Heal more effective.

#### Capes

Not much to say here, since capes work essentially the same, regardless of
build. The ideal here is a pink cape that is Chaos Scrolled for WATK and/or
scrolled for DEX.

#### Earrings

You will, predictably, want to scroll your earrings for DEX. To this end,
earrings that can be purchased from NPCs (and possibly others that are
similarly easy to farm) are likely going to be what you end up with. However,
there are some earrings that come with stats (particularly, DEX) right out of
the box:

| level | name                                          | availability    | notable stats            | notes                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----: | :-------------------------------------------- | :-------------- | :----------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    45 | Piercing of the Free Spirit                   | **quest**       | +1 all-stat, 4 slots     | May be available if your implementation has all of the Kerning Square quests implemented. Unfortunately only 4 slots (rather than the usual 5).                   |
|    50 | Altaire Earrings; Glittering Altaire Earrings | **party quest** | +1 all-stat; +2 all-stat | May be available as a reward for Ellin Party Quest.                                                                                                               |
|    80 | Gold Emerald Earrings                         | rare drop       | +2 DEX, +5 INT           | Dropped by The Boss. Good luck getting a pair. STR clerics and gishes are the only jobs that can really make use of both the DEX and the INT from these earrings. |

#### Eyewear

We&rsquo;re mostly looking for DEX and ACC here. Eyewear can be scrolled for
ACC (and 10%/30% scrolls for eyewear for ACC will give +1 DEX on success).
Eyewear is the same for all jobs, essentially, but of particular note here are
Broken Glasses (+1 all-stat, available from LPQ) and Spectrum Goggles (+1 STR,
+1 DEX, gachapon-only).

#### Facewear

Again, mostly looking for DEX and ACC. Facewear is easier to scroll for DEX
than Eyewear, simply because scrolls for facewear for AVOID will give DEX on
success, even in the case of 60%/70% scrolls (as opposed to only giving DEX on
the success of 10%/30% scrolls). Of particular note are Sad Masks, which give
an average of +10 ACC out of the box. There are also various other face
accessories that may or may not be available, depending on your implementation,
and the ones that you&rsquo;ll want are generally any that give WATK and/or DEX
and/or STR and/or ACC right out of the box. However, anything with slots can be
scrolled with AVOID scrolls.

### Other items

#### Potions/food/drinks

As a STR mage, you want all of the WATK that you can get. To this end, you will
probably want potions/food/drinks that give WATK buffs. This is true
particularly because your expected damage capabilities in melee are going to be
subpar when compared to ordinary (non-odd) jobs specialized in melee combat
(warriors, bandits, brawlers). Being smart with how you acquire and use WATK
buffs can help to narrow this gap. For WATK buffs that are available from NPCs
(&ldquo;WATK&sdot;s/meso&rdquo; is the magnitude of the WATK buff given,
multiplied by the duration, divided by the price per unit, and
&ldquo;meso/s&rdquo; is the cost of one second of the buff):

Also, be warned that these only allow up to 5 per stack, so they use up inventory space very inefficiently. |

The items here are in ascending order of WATK, brekaing any ties by sorting in
ascending order of WATK&sdot;s/meso. The two stand-out items here are the
Warrior Pill and the Cider. Both are tied for first place w.r.t.
WATK&sdot;s/meso, with the Warrior Pill being the low-cost but low-WATK
alternative to the higher-cost but higher-WATK Cider. This makes Ciders great
for doing big damage without breaking the bank or running into scarcity (as you
might with items that give WATK buffs greater than +20), and Warrior Pills
great for a WATK buff that you can have on at all times for a very low meso
cost (just 0.833 meso/s!).

Ciders, however, are burdened by only stacking up to 5 per inventory slot (they
are not burdened by the &minus;5 ACC debuff, since hat is easily cancelled
out); as a result, if you want the highest store-bought WATK buff possible,
_and_ you haven&rsquo;t the inventory space for Ciders, Warrior Elixirs are
your best bet. Other entries here are either not useful, or are situationally
useful when you happen to be near an NPC that sells them.

Also of note are accuracy potions/food/drinks. I recommend the use of Sniper
Pills (+10 ACC for 10 minutes, available for 500 mesos a pop in Ludibrium)
until you get Bless to at least level 10. Of course, you only have to use these
on an as-needed basis.
