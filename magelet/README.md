The **magelet** is an odd job/odd build in MapleStory that represents an
alternative notion of what a magician can be. On the surface, magelets appear
to be ordinary mages, but unlike their more usual counterparts &mdash; who
perform magic via a combination of their incredible intelligence with their
dedicated study of the arcane arts, or in the case of clerics/priests/bishops,
via a divine spiritual connection with their deit(y/ies) &mdash; magelets
accomplish acts of magic via sheer dumb (perhaps literally &ldquo;dumb&rdquo;,
in the sense of &ldquo;lacking **int**elligence&rdquo;) **lu**c**k** alone.
Although magelets typically have no formal training and no particularly special
intelligence, they find themselves giving way to magical occurences wherever
they go, and without any martial training, their enemies find it bizarrely
difficult to strike a true blow upon them!

The magelet&rsquo;s every move is merely a step in the unfolding of a miracle
over which they exercise little control. It is this striking irony &mdash; the
magelet&rsquo;s apparently extraordinary, or even impossible, feats, contrasted
with their unwitting participation therein &mdash; that makes the magelet both
legendary and perplexing. The magelet embodies the notion of a
&ldquo;fluke&rdquo;: the mere possibility of their existence remains
unexplained, and yet they nevertheless make their presence felt by the world.

## A quick note on the name

This class, or type of magician, is referred to throughout this document as
&ldquo;magelet&rdquo; (plural &ldquo;magelets&rdquo;), from &ldquo;mage&rdquo;
\+ the diminutive &ldquo;-let&rdquo;. This class is also commonly referred to
by various other names:

- LUK mage \[not to be confused with INT mages who put some points into LUK, to
  wear equipment\]
- LUK magician \[not to be confused with INT magicians who put some points into
  LUK, to wear equipment\]
- INTless mage \[not to be confused with other varieties of INTless mage, e.g.
  STR mages and DEX mages\]
- INTless magician \[not to be confused with other varieties of INTless
  magician, e.g. STR magicians and DEX magicians\]
- Pure LUK mage
- Pure LUK magician

## Pros and cons

Discussing the pros and cons of the magelet as a class can only be done with
the understanding that the magelet _is an odd class_, and is therefore
inherently suboptimal in many ways (if it weren&rsquo;t, we would be very lucky
indeed to be able to call it an &ldquo;odd&rdquo;, or &ldquo;unusual&rdquo;,
class).

Pros:

- Very high avoidability.
- Ability to effortlessly equip many powerful magician weapons that are
  otherwise quite difficult to use.
- Ability to effectively use claws that lack job requirements (e.g. the Magical
  Mitten).
- Fortune and miracles follow in your wake.

Cons:

- Your magical attacks that deal damage based on your MATK/INT (i.e. most
  everything except for poison effects) suffer from your INTless nature.
  Although you have no accuracy issues whatsoever, your damage scales almost
  exclusively with your equipment and your skills&rsquo; levels.
- Your incredible fortune may inspire jealousy in those who misunderstand the
  magelet.

## AP build

The AP build of the magelet is what defines the magelet and what makes them so
fortuitous:

- STR: 4
- DEX: 4
- INT: 20
- LUK: \[all other APs go here\]

## Three paths

Like more usual mages, magelets also have three paths to choose from:
fire/poison, ice/lightning, and cleric(/priest/bishop). All three are perfectly
viable, but each has its pros and cons, so it is a matter of your intended
playstyle when it comes to choosing. This section provides a brief overview of
the benefits and sore spots of each, from a magelet perspective.

### Fire/poison

Fire/poison seems to be, at first, the obvious choice, simply because their
poison attacks can deal damage-over-time (DoT) that does not scale with
MATK/INT. This effectively removes some of the magelet&rsquo;s difficulties.

Pros:

- Poison DoT (i.e. not the initial damage, but everything after that) scales
  exclusively with the afflicted&rsquo;s MAXHP, meaning that this damage is not
  pessimised by your INTless nature.
- Benefits from magic-damage-per-minute amplifying skills oriented towards
  damage (rather than general utility), such as Meditation, Element
  Amplification, and Spell Booster.
    - Meditation is also of some party buff utility when there are
      cleric(s)/priest(s)/bishop(s) in the party.
- Has the highest single-target DPS of the three paths.
- Known for extremely fast third-job leveling, due to Poison Mist.
- Can benefit from the use of Slow as a method of crowd control.

Cons:

- Has little to contribute to parties most of the time, other than raw damage
  output, due to only having Slow for crowd control and Meditation as a party
  buff.
- Has no multi-target attacks until third job.
- Has worse burst-like (read: non-DoT) mobbing than ice/lightnings (Explosion
  vs. Ice Strike in third job, no mobbing at all in second job).
- Lacks Bless, meaning typically lower AVOID unless buffed by a
  cleric/priest/bishop party member.
- More fragile than clerics/priests/bishops.

### Ice/lightning

Ice/lightning mages are renowned for their area-of-effect (AoE) nuking
abilities and incredible crowd control. Ice/lightning magelets fare similarly.

Pros:

- By far the best crowd control of the three paths, as freezing is very
  effective and deterministic.
- Formidable mobbing/AoE nuking from second job onwards.
- Benefits from magic-damage-per-minute amplifying skills oriented towards
  damage (rather than general utility), such as Meditation, Element
  Amplification, and Spell Booster.
    - Meditation is also of some party buff utility when there are
      cleric(s)/priest(s)/bishop(s) in the party.

Cons:

- Lacks some of the high single-target DPS of fire/poisons, and lacks the
  general utility of clerics/priests/bishops.
- Lacks Bless, meaning typically lower AVOID unless buffed by a
  cleric/priest/bishop party member.
- More fragile than clerics/priests/bishops.

### Cleric/priest/bishop

Besides the obvious general utility of clerics/priests/bishops, this path has
yet another trick up its sleeve: Heal&rsquo;s damage scales with LUK! It does,
however, also scale with MATK; in particular, the damage dealt per use of Heal
scales as &Theta;(MATK&nbsp;&sdot;&nbsp;(INT&nbsp;+&nbsp;LUK)). This means that
being INTless still hurts (because it hurts your MATK), but at least the damage
does scale linearly with LUK, which is better than most magic attacks, whose
damage does not scale with LUK at all.

Pros:

- Has all of the general utility of a cleric/priest/bishop.
- Has solid mobbing from second job onwards.
- Heal&rsquo;s effectiveness (at least, in terms of
  damage-dealing)<sup>\[1\]</sup> actually scales with LUK.
- Has access to Bless, for a sweet +20 AVOID buff.
- The sturdiest of the three paths.
- Already has a summon (Summon Dragon) by third job.

Cons:

- Relying on Heal for attacking starts to get underwhelming during third job.
- Worst single-target attacking of all three paths.
- Heal can only damage undeads.
- The only path that does not benefit from magic-damage-per-minute amplifying
  skills oriented towards damage (rather than general utility), such as
  Meditation, Element Amplification, and Spell Booster.
- Heal&rsquo;s regenerative powers do not scale with LUK<sup>\[1\]</sup>.
- Has little in the way of crowd control, besides Doom (a third job skill, and
  quite marginal for the priest, especially because they are almost always
  using AoE attacks).

<summary>Footnotes for &ldquo;Cleric/priest/bishop&rdquo;</summary>

\[1\]: Heal&rsquo;s regenerative powers reportedly _used to_ scale with LUK
&mdash; q.v. [Ayumilove&rsquo;s MapleStory Formula
Compilation](https://ayumilovemaple.wordpress.com/2009/09/06/maplestory-formula-compilation/)
&mdash; but the aforementioned formula compilation does not have a complete
formula for Heal recovery at the time of its writing (writing
&ldquo;something&rdquo; in place of a missing term). Ayumilove&rsquo;s post is
dated 2009-09-06, but is merely a repost of an earlier `southperry.net` thread
from 2008-07-13 (due to Russt, q.v. [this
archival](https://web.archive.org/web/20090315032621/http://www.southperry.net/forums/showthread.php?t=855));
but this thread is itself also a repost of an _even earlier_ post by
Technolink, which is undated and unreferenced (I couldn&rsquo;t find it).
Russt&rsquo;s wording of &ldquo;Technolink posted this in SW awhile back, but
it didn't quite catch on...&rdquo; is vague, but might suggest that
Technolink&rsquo;s original post was sometime during late 2007/early 2008 or
so.

Taking a quick look in XiuzSource, however, indicates that XiuzSource&rsquo;s
understanding of Heal&rsquo;s recovery is that it scales only on the
caster&rsquo;s MATK and on the level of the Heal skill (i.e. its
&ldquo;recovery rate&rdquo; as listed in the skill description). It&rsquo;s
difficult to say for certain without testing (as any given server may have
changed the formula themselves, of course), but because most servers (e.g.
MapleLegends) derive from Odin/XiuzSource in one way or another, it&rsquo;s
safe to say that Heal&rsquo;s regenerative powers _generally_ do not scale with
LUK. I encourage any cleric/priest/bishop magelets/gishlets to test this.

## Skill builds

Skill builds for magelets tend to be fairly similar to those of their INT-based
counterparts, with a few exceptions:

- Magelet skill builds will want to focus more on the strengths that the
  magelet still retains: for fire/poisons, this is typically poison attacks;
  for ice/lightnings, this is typically AoE nukes and freezing spells; for
  clerics/priests/bishops, this is typically Heal.
- Magelet skill builds cannot afford to save quite as much cost (read: mesos)
  as more mainstream builds. The magelet needs all of the raw power that they
  can get, even if it is somewhat less efficient.
- Spell Booster is a higher priority than Element Amplification for magelets.
  While it is common for ordinary mages to keep their Spell Booster at level 6
  for a while, magelets will want to do the same, but at **level 11** (the
  point at and beyond which the boosting effect is at its largest). The
  reasoning here is that magelets have a hard time one-shotting their foes, for
  the most part, and Element Amplification works as a percentage of the raw
  (read: before MDEF) damage that is done per-strike. As a result, while
  Element Amplification is extremely beneficial for magelets, during early-ish
  third job, the magelet&rsquo;s extra damage due to Element Amplification is
  _somewhat eclipsed by the variance in the magelet&rsquo;s damage output_
  (natural variance, as well as variance due to the targets&rsquo; MDEF). Spell
  Booster helps enormously to get in the extra attacks needed to subdue each
  foe. Also, poison DoT effects are not affected by Element Amplification
  anyways.

Personally, I play an ice/lightning magelet. For this reason, I will reproduce
my skill builds here, for ice/lightning magelets only. Magelets of the other
two paths (fire/poison and cleric/priest/bishop) can make use of the notes
above in combination with the ice/lightning skill builds provided below, to
forge their own builds.

### Magician

The first job skill build is very standard, but for completeness, it is
nevertheless reproduced here.

Note that sometime around the turn of second to third job, I use first job SP
resets to reset SP out of Magic Claw, and use them to max out both Magic Armor
and Improved MP Recovery (as defensive and cost-saving measures). Because you
have 1 leftover second job SP by the time you hit level 70, this ends up
leaving Magic Claw at level 1.

|       level | SP allocation                                                   |

| 28&ndash;30 | +3 Magic Armor \[11\]                                           |

### Ice/lightning wizard

This skill build assumes that you are using potions/food that grant a MATK
buff; for more info on this, see the &ldquo;Potions/food/drinks&rdquo; section
below. Such buffs are useful from level 8 all the way until you get Meditation
to a high enough level (and for clerics/priests/bishops, they are useful any
time there isn&rsquo;t an ice/lightning nor a fire/poison in the party). This
is in line with the principle outlined above that magelet skill builds tend to
be less cost-saving than INT-based skill builds.

Note that sometime around the turn of second to third job, I use first job SP
resets to reset SP out of Magic Claw, and use them to max out both Magic Armor
and Improved MP Recovery (as defensive and cost-saving measures). Because you
have 1 leftover second job SP by the time you hit level 70, this ends up
leaving Magic Claw at level 1.

If MATK potions/food are too inaccessible, it is possible to prioritise
Meditation over Cold Beam.

MP Eater can be prioritised over Teleport, depending on what you are doing at
levels 59&ndash;70.

Slow is not skilled at all, because it is basically useless for ice/lightnings
(Slow is much more oriented towards fire/poisons).

Our first SP goes into Element Amplification, as the first level of this skill
is the most powerful; we get a considerable all-around damage boost from it.
Then we get straight to maxing Ice Strike. Ice Strike is your bread &amp;
butter! It is a powerful AoE nuke with stellar range, good attack speed, and it
freezes as well! Then we get Spell Booster up to level 11, as discussed above
(under &ldquo;Skill builds&rdquo;) to speed up our Ice Strikes (and
Cold Beams). Then Element Amplification is next, for the sweet, sweet damage
boost.

After this point (getting to level 94), the absolute essentials are already out
of the way. From here we max Element Composition in order to get a more
powerful version of Cold Beam. By this point you have three main single-target
attacks available in your skillbook: Cold Beam, Element Composition, and
Thunder Spear. Here is how Element Composition stacks up with the competition:

- Versus Cold Beam: Element Composition attacks more slowly than Cold Beam
  (810&nbsp;ms&nbsp;&div;&nbsp;720&nbsp;ms&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.125 times more
  slowly)<sup>\[1\]</sup>. Both skills freeze for the same duration (2&nbsp;s).
  Element Composition has a basic attack of 140 at max level, which is
  140&nbsp;&div;&nbsp;100&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.4 times greater than Cold Beam&rsquo;s
  basic attack of 100. This (1.4&nbsp;&#x226b;&nbsp;1.125) means that maxed
  Element Composition is always better DPS and always better damage-per-hit
  than Cold Beam. Also, Element Composition is typed with lightning in addition
  to ice, so it can do extra damage to lightning-weak monsters, not just
  ice-weak ones. The superiority of Element Composition is even greater when
  using a lightning-typed Elemental Wand or Staff (any whose names end with
  &ldquo;4&rdquo; or &ldquo;8&rdquo;), again because it is typed with lightning
  in addition to ice.
- Versus Thunder Spear: Element Composition does less damage-per-hit than
  Thunder Spear (assuming that you are not using an ice-typed Elemental Wand
  nor Staff, i.e. any whose names end with &ldquo;3&rdquo; or &ldquo;7&rdquo;,
  and that you are fighting an elementally-neutral monster), because the
  Thunder Spear has a basic attack of
  170&nbsp;&div;&nbsp;140&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.214&hellip; times more than that of
  Elemental Composition (both at max level). However, Elemental Composition
  freezes (for 2&nbsp;s), whereas Thunder Spear does not, and Elemental
  Composition attacks much more swiftly than Thunder Spear
  (1140&nbsp;ms&nbsp;&div;&nbsp;810&nbsp;ms&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.407&hellip; times
  more swiftly)<sup>\[1\]</sup>. This
  (1.407&hellip;&nbsp;&#x226b;&nbsp;1.214&hellip;) means that Elemental
  Composition is generally better DPS than Thunder Spear, unless the
  target&rsquo;s MDEF is extremely high. The problem for Thunder Spear is, of
  course, worse when your target is weaker to ice than to lightning, and/or you
  are using an ice-typed Elemental Wand or Staff (which is probably true if you
  are using an Elemental Wand or Staff at all, since you care the most about
  Ice Strike).

Once we have Element Composition maxed, we have the essentials out of the way,
and have our main single-target attack maxed as well. From here we max Partial
Resistance; Partial Resistance is not as great as the priest&rsquo;s Elemental
Resistance, but it still makes for a sturdier magelet, and is a decent
cost-saving measure.

Beyond this point, it really is up to you as to how you spend your remaining
third job SP. Investing more SP into Spell Booster is a nice convenience (Spell
Booster has a casting animation that is a bit of a pain in the ass, similarly
to Holy Symbol). Investing many SPs into Thunder Spear means a nice
single-target nuke that has excellent per-hit damage &mdash; particularly
against lightning-weak monsters, of course. And finally, investing into Seal
_can_ be useful (although not so much for ice/lightnings as for fire/poisons,
since ice/lightnings can freeze with Ice Strike) to partially disable monsters
for a longer duration than your freezing attacks can fully disable them (freeze
lasts for just 2&nbsp;s).

## Itemization

A magelet is nothing without her equipment and her gear&hellip;

No, really. Magelets (particularly of the ice/lightning and
cleric/priest/bishop varieties) are easily one of the most gear-dependent jobs
in all of MapleStory. Like ordinary mages, you will want INT and MATK most of
all from your gear/buffs; INT is more valuable per-point than raw MATK, because
1 point of INT increases your total MATK by 1 point anyways, _in addition to_
giving other benefits of INT. But magelets, due to being INTless, need these
things even more desperately than INT mages (LUKless or otherwise).

In contrast to INT mages (particularly in contrast to those who are LUKless),
getting sources of AVOID from your gear/buffs (raw AVOID and/or LUK and/or DEX)
is quite useful. Your AVOID is already naturally high due to your pure LUK
nature, and so additional sources of AVOID are very welcome, because they
actually significantly increase the rate at which you dodge attacks. Keep in
mind that each point of LUK grants 0.5 AVOID, and each point of DEX grants 0.25
AVOID.

### Equipment

#### Armaments

Armaments are perhaps the most interesting aspect of gearing up a magelet. To
some degree, the armaments that they use will overlap with those of a pure INT
(INT mage of the LUKless variety) mage, thus making these armaments very
standard, as pure INT mages are by far the most common type of mage. This is
because pure INT mages largely rely on armaments that have no stat
requirements, and thus can be equipped by _any_ variety of mage (and in some
cases, like with umbrellas, non-mages as well).

However, while magelets cannot equip armaments with significant INT
requirements, they can equip those that _just_ have a significant LUK
requirement. These armaments are bolded in the table of magelet weapons below.

Note that &ldquo;TMA&rdquo; refers to the average **total** MATK of a clean
version of the armament in question. The total MATK is the sum of the raw MATK
and the INT. If the armament in question does give >0 INT on average, then that
is noted under &ldquo;other stats&rdquo;. Also note that element-based damage
bonuses that apply to spells with poison type do **not** apply to poison DoT
damage (which is solely base on the victim&rsquo;s MAXHP).

The &ldquo;Heart Staff&rdquo; is, confusingly, a wand, not a staff.

#### Shields

The ultimate magelet shield is, of course, a Maple Magician Shield (assuming
that your implementation has the full set of 2008 GMS Three Year Anniversary
Event maple equips). With an average of +2 INT clean, solid defenses, and most
importantly, 10 slots, it can hardly be beaten.

Other than the Maple Magician Shield, the magelet largely has access to shields
without job requirements, like the Stolen Fence and the Pan Lid. However, if
your gear is good enough, you may be able to equip the Mystic Shield, which is
a level 22 magician-only shield that requires at least 68 INT to equip. This
means getting at least 48 INT from your non-shield equipment. It is, however, a
nice shield, with +1 INT on average when clean.

#### Headgear

Magelets, unfortunately, do not have access to any of the magician-specific
headgear, due to their INTless nature. There is, however, one notable
exception: if you are fortunate enough to be playing on an implementation that
has the extended first-job quests (in the magician&rsquo;s case, culminating in
a battle with the Marbas boss monster), you should obtain the level 18 Marbas
Hat. The +12 INT helps immensely, and the other stats are quite good as well.

If you cannot obtain the Marbas Hat, or just want something that will increase
your DPS, you still have some good options (&ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; methods of
availability &mdash; that is, NPCs, (party) quests, monster drops, and crafting
&mdash; are bolded):

This brings us to the ideal end-game hats: Zakum Helmets, &ldquo;Tar&rdquo;
(Targa) Hats, and Ravana Helmets. These headgears are so incredibly powerful
that they need no introduction. Zakum Helmets are generally more accessible, as
Zakum tends to be run fairly often in most implementations, and only requires
level 50 (instead of the level 80 of Targa Hats, and the level 70 of Ravana
Helmets). The four main attributes of these headgears that we care about are
their TMA, their total AVOID, their number of slots, and their level:

| name            |  level |    TMA | total AVOID |  slots |
| :-------------- | -----: | -----: | ----------: | -----: |
| Zakum Helmet    | **50** |     15 |   **31.25** | **10** |
| Targa Hat (LUK) |     80 |     15 |   **31.25** | **10** |
| Targa Hat (INT) |     80 |     17 |       30.25 | **10** |
| Ravana Helmet   |     70 | **18** |       23.50 |      7 |

When it comes to scrolling headgear, obviously you ideally want to scroll for
INT. Scrolling for HP/DEF can also be nice. All-stat hats can be effectively
Chaos Scrolled, if you&rsquo;re feeling really saucy, or somehow have a large
supply of Chaos Scrolls.

#### Clothing

Again, like with headgear, magelets unfortunately largely lack access to
magician-specific attire of this kind (tops, bottoms, and overalls). Obviously,
you want to scroll an overall for INT (or perhaps even LUK, or a combination of
the two). This leaves you choosing between basically two different overalls, as
starting points for scrolling:

Bathrobes:

- Are able to be purchased from an NPC, and thus highly available for scrolling.
- Have a lower level requirement (20 &lt; 30).
- Give a nice SPEED boost (+10 SPEED), but are defensively inferior (+20 WDEF
  &lt; +30 WDEF; +0 AVOID &lt; +10 AVOID).

Sauna Robes, on the other hand:

- Are more difficult to acquire, since you have to do a rather difficult quest
  (and one that has a minimum level requirement of 30) just to get one.
- Have a higher level requirement (30 &gt; 20).
- Are defensively superior (+30 WDEF &gt; +20 WDEF; +10 AVOID &gt; +0 AVOID),
  but do not grant any SPEED.

The fact that bathrobes can be purchased from an NPC makes them, by and large,
the clear favorite, since we really care about the scrolling outcome, not the
base stats of the armour. However, magelets will prefer Sauna Robes, all other
things being equal, since the AVOID is more important than the SPEED.

#### Footwear

Again, not much magician-specific footwear here, unless you have access to
Marbas Shoes, in which case, just use those. The plan here is to scroll for
AVOID (unless you have some Chaos Scrolls just lying around&hellip;).

The usual suspects here are:

| level | name                 | availability      | TMA | notable stats                                  | notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----: | :------------------- | :---------------- | --: | :--------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

|    26 | Whitebottom Boots    | **NPC**, **drop** |   0 | +3 SPEED                                       | If all else fails, a little SPEED and a little WDEF is better than nothing. They even come in four different colors!                                                                                                                  |
|    30 | Squishy Shoes        | **party quest**   |   1 | +1 all-stat, +3 SPEED, +5 MDEF                 | Nab one (or more) of these if at all possible, from KPQ.                                                                                                                                                                              |

|    50 | Yellow Snowshoes     | rare drop         |   3 | +3 INT, +3 DEX, 7 slots, +10 MDEF              | Although this is a dropped item, good luck getting it from Female Boss! Very powerful.                                                                                                                                                |
|    80 | Violet Snowshoes     | rare drop         |   0 | 7 slots, +5 JUMP, +5 SPEED, +20 MDEF, +50 WDEF | Mostly known for having 7 slots (instead of 5), these also have pretty decent stats. Good luck getting a pair from The Boss!                                                                                                          |

Jewelery Shoes (which come in three colours: Blue, Purple, Red) may be worth
looking into, if you can get the 62 INT needed to equip them. They grant +1 INT
on average.

#### Gloves

Again, no real access to magician-specific gloves (other than Marbas Gloves,
again depending on implementation). You will want to get some gloves with no
job requirements, and scroll them for MATK. Some notable ones (more interesting
than plain Work Gloves):

| level | name                   | availability          | TMA | notable stats     | notes                                                                          |
| ----: | :--------------------- | :-------------------- | --: | :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    10 | Purple Work Gloves     | gachapon              |   0 | +1 LUK            |                                                                                |
|    10 | Yellow Work Gloves     | **drop**, gachapon    |   1 | +1 INT            | Drops from Cheap Amplifiers in Taipei 101.                                     |
|    20 | Pink Marker            | gachapon              |   0 | +2 LUK            |                                                                                |
|    20 | Red Marker             | gachapon              |   2 | +2 INT            |                                                                                |
|    35 | Mushking Leather Glove | **quest**             |   2 | +2 MATK           | Requires access to Mushroom Kingdom.                                           |
|    50 | Goddess Wristband      | **party quest**       |   1 | +1 MATK, +10 MDEF | Available from completing OPQ (Orbis Party Quest) a requisite number of times. |
|    50 | Flamekeeper Cordon     | rare party quest drop |   8 | +8 MATK           | Available from CWKPQ (Crimsonwood Keep Party Quest).                           |

A cheap way of getting a decent pair of gloves is to take a pair that already
has a TMA of 1 or 2 clean, and then scrolling all 5 slots with 100% MATK
scrolls.

Again, Green and Purple Morricans may be worth looking into, if you can get the
62 INT needed to equip them. They grant +1 and +2 INT on average, respectively.

#### Capes

Again, we are generally looking for the highest TMA possible. This usually
means going for a Purple Adventurer Cape or a Purple Gaia Cape, if possible.
Here are some notable capes:

| level | name                                | availability     | TMA | notable stats                                       | notes                                                                                                                 |

#### Earrings

You will, predictably, want to scroll your earrings for INT. To this end,
earrings that can be purchased from NPCs (and possibly others that are
similarly easy to farm) are likely going to be what you end up with. However,
there are some earrings that come with stats (particularly, INT/MATK) right out
of the box:

| level | name                                          | availability       |  TMA | notable stats                 | notes                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----: | :-------------------------------------------- | :----------------- | ---: | :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

|    40 | Crystal Leaf Earrings                         | rare craft         |    3 | +3 MATK, 6 slots              | John Barricade craft item.                                                                                                                                                                   |

Unfortunately only 4 slots (rather than the usual 5).                                              |
|    50 | Altaire Earrings; Glittering Altaire Earrings | **party quest**    | 1; 2 | +1 all-stat; +2 all-stat      | May be available as a reward for Ellin Party Quest.                                                                                                                                          |
|    80 | Gold Emerald Earrings                         | rare drop          |    5 | +5 INT, +2 DEX                | Dropped by The Boss. Good luck getting a pair. STR clerics/priests/bishops, and gishes/gishlets, are the only jobs that can really make use of both the DEX and the INT from these earrings. |

#### Eyewear

Again, we&rsquo;re mostly looking for TMA here. Eyewear can be scrolled for
INT. Eyewear is the same for all jobs, essentially, but of particular note here
are:

- Broken Glasses: +1 all-stat, 3 slots, available from LPQ.
- (White) Raccoon Mask: 7 slots, gachapon-only.

#### Facewear

Facewear is best scrolled with AVOID. To this end, Angry Masks are ideal, as
they have 7 slots and come with an average of +1 AVOID when clean.

### Other items

#### Potions/food/drinks

As a magelet, you want all of the MATK that you can get. To this end, magelet
clerics/priests/bishops &mdash; as well as other magelets who have yet to max
out Meditation &mdash; will probably want potions/food/drinks that give MATK
buffs. For MATK buffs that are available from NPCs
(&ldquo;MATK&sdot;s/meso&rdquo; is the magnitude of the MATK buff given,
multiplied by the duration, divided by the price per unit, and
&ldquo;meso/s&rdquo; is the cost of one second of the buff):

| name             | MATK | MATK&sdot;s/meso | meso/s | duration | meso/unit | available from                                                                                                                                                                                              |

The items here are in ascending order of MATK, breaking any ties by sorting in
ascending order of MATK&sdot;s/meso. The highlights here are the Coke Town
pills and the Wizard Elixir: Wizard Elixirs simply give the largest buff, at a
whopping +20 MATK buff making Meditation unnecessary for its duration, and the
Coke Town pills are the most efficient (with the Coke Pill coming in at a
whopping 12 MATK&sdot;s/meso!).

In the absence of Coke Town, Magic Pills are also quite efficient.

Magelets who are not clerics/priests/bishops, and magelets who are clerics but
have not yet maxed Bless, may want to look for consumables that grant AVOID
buffs:

The clear winner here is the Dexterity Pill, although the Archer Elixir is
quite useful as well, due to having the largest AVOID buff (equalling that of
maxed Bless).
