Meanwhile Ulysses, as long as his arrows lasted, had been shooting the suitors
one by one, and they fell thick on one another: when his arrows gave out, he
set the bow to stand against the end wall of the house by the door post, and
hung a shield four hides thick about his shoulders; on his comely head he set
his helmet, well wrought with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly
above it, and he grasped two redoubtable bronze-shod spears.

"A woodsman, variously wielding the Composite Bow and the Monkey Wrench")

The **woodsman** is an odd job/odd build in MapleStory that, at its core,
represents the ability to both competently wield weapons of archery (bows
and/or crossbows) _and_ competently wield weapons of melee combat (spears,
polearms, swords, &amp;c.). Sindits _can_ parallel the woodsman&rsquo;s ability
to do both ranged &amp; melee physical DPS, but where the sindit is a
mainstream build designed merely to overcome the awkward early power curve of
dagger-wielding rogues, the woodsman represents a genuine dedication to the
classical martial arts. With that dedication comes a totally different skillset
and array of playstyles that makes the woodsman both unique, and redoubtable in
the eyes of mortals.

## A quick note on the name

This job is referred to throughout this document as &ldquo;woodsman&rdquo;
(plural &ldquo;woodsmen&rdquo;). This job is also commonly referred to by
simply prepending &ldquo;STR&rdquo; (or &ldquo;strength&rdquo;) to the name of
the ordinary job in question &mdash; e.g. &ldquo;STR hunter&rdquo; &mdash; or
more generically as &ldquo;STR archer&rdquo;. To avoid confusion with DEX
archers who have a base STR higher than 4 (i.e. normal, but also not STRless,
archers), &ldquo;pure STR&rdquo; can be prepended instead of simply
&ldquo;STR&rdquo;. Other names for this job include:

- Woodman
- Huntsman
- Forester
- DEXless archer/hunter/&amp;c.

&ldquo;Woodsman&rdquo;/&ldquo;woodsmen&rdquo; unfortunately can sound rather
gendered, and so &ldquo;woodswoman&rdquo; (plural &ldquo;woodswomen&rdquo;) is
sometimes used instead, when appropriate &mdash; although this only solves one
of the problems. Rather than attempting to fix the English language and write a
MapleStory guide in one fell swoop, &ldquo;woodsman&rdquo; and
&ldquo;woodsmen&rdquo; are here used as ungendered, catch-all terms.

## Pros and cons

Discussing the pros and cons of the woodsman as a job can only be done with the
understanding that the woodsman _is an odd job_, and is therefore inherently
suboptimal in many ways (if it weren&rsquo;t, we would be very lucky indeed to
be able to call it an &ldquo;odd&rdquo;, or &ldquo;unusual&rdquo;, job).

Pros:

- Ability to proficiently switch between ranged combat and melee combat.
- Ability to do ranged combat at all as an odd job, considering that most odd
  jobs are essentially stuck with melee only.
- Fairly powerful mobbing abilities, starting from level 30 and onwards.
- Less accuracy issues than many other jobs (including some odd jobs), due to
  having a head-start on their DEX (25), focusing on DEX for equipment, and
  having skills like The Blessing of Amazon, Focus, and even (w.r.t. ranged
  combat) mastery skills.
- Gets a relatively powerful mob manipulation skill by second job: Power
  Knock-Back (PKB).
- Has the possibility of eventually getting Sharp Eyes as a skill, for a very
  powerful party buff (only applicable if fourth job exists).
- Enviable aesthetics.

Cons:

- Switching between ranged combat and melee combat is not as seamless as one
  would hope, because you cannot be in an &ldquo;alert&rdquo; (i.e.
  &ldquo;catching your breath&rdquo;) stance while switching weapons. Contrast
  this with gishes, who may not be able to do _physical_ ranged damage, but can
  nevertheless cast ranged spells and do physical melee combat, both without
  switching weapons at all.
- Considerably worse accuracy in comparison to an ordinary archer, due to
  having a base DEX of exactly 25.
- Unfortunately not as good at ranged combat, nor at melee combat, as some
  other jobs are (particularly non-odd jobs, i.e. ordinary/mainstream jobs).
  Given the same equipment, any ordinary archer build (STRless or otherwise)
  will be able to outperform you at range (although you will outperform them at
  melee, of course) easily. Any warrior, bandit, or brawler build that could be
  considered &ldquo;standard&rdquo; or &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; in any way will
  be able to outperform you in melee from at least second job onwards, and
  likely earlier as well (although you will outperform them at range, of
  course).
- Does worse PKB damage than ordinary archers and (cross)bow-whackers, although
  the damage is still considerable.

## AP build

Woodsmen are defined, in part, by having a base (that is, not including bonuses
from equipment or buffs) DEX of exactly 25. _Technically_, as long as you
satisfy that constraint, any AP build is valid. However, only one such AP build
actually makes sense, and that is leaving your base DEX, INT, and LUK at 25, 4,
and 4, respectively, and putting all other APs into STR:

- STR: \[all APs go here\]
- DEX: 25
- INT: 4
- LUK: 4

## Skill builds

Skill builds can be _quite_ flexible here, so I&rsquo;ve split skill builds
into essentially two routes: the wannabe DEX archer (here called &ldquo;archery
specialisation&rdquo;), and the wannabe permabeginner-but-with-skills (here
called &ldquo;melee specialisation&rdquo;). Not only are these obviously not
the only two viable skill builds, but their names are also perhaps misleading.
The &ldquo;melee specialist&rdquo; is perfectly adept at archery from second
job onwards (and is good enough to be useful in first job), and the
&ldquo;archery specialist&rdquo; is perfectly adept at melee, even if they can
suffer from more accuracy issues during early second job (albeit not quite as
many issues as many other melee jobs).

This first-job SP allocation strategy is essentially identical to your typical
archer&rsquo;s. The only thing that might surprise some people is that we leave
Focus at level 0. Why leave Focus at 0 and spend those SPs on The Blessing of
Amazon, when you could spend them on Focus and get both accuracy _and_
avoidability? The simple answer is that buffs of the same kind (e.g. two
different accuracy buffs) do **not** stack. This effectively means that Focus
is useless at levels below 11, and situationally, it may even be useless at max
level; Sniper Pills (available from any of 3 different NPCs in Ludibrium for
roughly 500 mesos a pop) already give a +10 accuracy buff, and there are other
consumables that give even more powerful accuracy buffs (including, but not
limited to, Maple Pops, which drop from two distinct species of low-level
monsters and grant a +100 accuracy buff). Plus, having a Cleric in your party
typically negates the usefulness (due to Bless), and the avoidability component
is already obsoleted by the Archer Elixir (available from an NPC in New Leaf
City for 5k mesos a pop), which grants a +20 avoidability buff. The Blessing of
Amazon, on the other hand, is a _passive_ skill, and thus stacks with
everything.

This build starts out with one point into Arrow Blow, because that single SP is
enough to grant you a ranged single-target DPS skill that is significantly
superior to simply basic-attacking with your (cross)bow. You can, if you want,
forgo Arrow Blow entirely in favor of getting Focus up to level 17 (instead of
level 16) by the time that you&rsquo;re level 21; however, I expect that for
most people, a single SP is worth it here. Because we are focusing on melee
combat (for _at least_ first job), we don&rsquo;t have to frontload any
archery-specific skills, and can also safely leave Double Shot at level 0
without sacrificing performance of our main second-job attack, Arrow Bomb/Iron
Arrow. For this reason, we instead frontload accuracy boosts in order to allow
ourselves to fight higher-level and higher-avoidability monsters at lower
character levels. In order to not totally neglect archery (again, particularly
because we will be getting Arrow Bomb/Iron Arrow at level 30), we do still need
to max The Eye of Amazon, as well as Critical Shot. For this reason, we stop
putting SPs into Focus once the skill is at level 16 (rather than at level 20,
the maximum level of the skill). See the &ldquo;Archer (archery
specialisation)&rdquo; skill build section for a justification on why we
prioritise The Blessing of Amazon over Focus.

We start with the basics here: one point into Arrow Bomb to be able to use it,
and then max Bow Mastery for the damage, accuracy, and damage stability. Then
we immediately dip into Bow Booster to get it to a one minute duration of extra
fast shootin&rsquo;. Then Arrow Bomb is maxed, to increase the damage and the
stun proc chance of our main attacking skill.

At this point, all of the super essential stuff is out of the way, which means
that we can get back to dumping SP into first-job skills in order to salvage as
many precious and much-needed points of accuracy as possible. First is maxing
The Blessing of Amazon, for reasons outlined in the &ldquo;Archer (archery
specialisation)&rdquo; skill build section. Then we get a little greedy and go
directly from level 0 Focus to maxed Focus; it&rsquo;s OK to leave this for
last or whatever, especially if you aren&rsquo;t having any accuracy problems
or your accuracy problems wouldn&rsquo;t be ameliorated by Focus, but
I&rsquo;ve put it here because it doesn&rsquo;t cause you to really put off any
super important skills. If you expect to _always_ have at least a +20 accuracy
buff from other sources, then Focus isn&rsquo;t much good, but we&rsquo;re
assuming that maxing Focus is at least resonably important, since it allows you
to _guarantee_ that you really do _always_ have at least a +20 accuracy buff.

Then we max Power Knock-Back, made even more powerful by your stronk arms.
Finally, the rest of the SPs go into Bow Booster and Soul Arrow, keeping the
two as close as possible in terms of duration. Why put off Soul Arrow for so
long (first acquired at level 64)? For two main reasons:

1. The reality is that Soul Arrow is a convenience skill; that is, with just a
   bit of quiver management, the need for Soul Arrow is all but eliminated. Not
   using Soul Arrow is mostly an issue for inventory space.
2. While ordinary archers are constantly seeking more DEX and more WATK in
   order to boost their damage output ever higher, I would argue that woodsmen
   have this same need, but even more intensely. As a woodsman using an
   ordinary archer&rsquo;s weapon, you are constantly fighting the fact that
   you are DEXless, and yet are wielding a weapon whose main damage stat is
   DEX. In your quest to ameliorate this problem as much as you can, one
   accessible source of WATK is that of the WATK bonuses granted by your
   ammunition. Particularly, the cheapest kind are bronzed ammunition, which
   grant +1 WATK and can be purchased from various NPCs for 10 mesos per unit
   (20k mesos for a ream of 2k units). More beneficial are colored ammunition
   (red for arrows, blue for quarrels), which grant a whopping +4 WATK, and can
   be purchased in Showa Town for 40 mesos per unit (80k mesos for a ream of 2k
   units); diamond ammunition grants the same bonus for half the price,
   although diamond ammunition can only be purchased by those that are allies
   of the Raven Ninja Clan. When Soul Arrow is active, you cannot benefit from
   any special ammunition.

All of that being said, if you, for example, are playing on a server where you
are starved for &ldquo;use&rdquo; inventory space, you can simply slip in the
first two levels of Soul Arrow somewhere earlier in the build.

specialised&rdquo; hunter, in comparison to the more stark difference between
their first jobs. As a result, many of the justifications for these skill
builds are more-or-less the same, so refer to the &ldquo;Hunter (archery
specialisation)&rdquo; skill build for those.

One difference here is that the &ldquo;melee specialised&rdquo; hunter had a
significantly different first-job skill build, which affects the exact course
of the second-job skill build. Also, we prioritise Power Knock-Back over ranged
single-target DPS, because the &ldquo;melee specialised&rdquo; hunter probably
just wants to melee when the situation arises to be dealing single-target DPS.
The &ldquo;melee specialised&rdquo; hunter (generally) pulls out their bow for
one skill and one skill only: Arrow Bomb. Power Knock-Back helps to control
mobs that get close enough to disallow Arrow Bomb from being used. Double Shot
is neglected because by the time that you would ever get around to using it,
you would already be level 70 and have level 1 Strafe.

### Crossbowman (archery specialisation)

Ditto of &ldquo;Hunter (archery specialisation)&rdquo;, but replace &ldquo;Bow
Mastery&rdquo; with &ldquo;Crossbow Mastery&rdquo;, &ldquo;Arrow Bomb&rdquo;
with &ldquo;Iron Arrow&rdquo;, and so on.

### Crossbowman (melee specialisation)

Ditto of &ldquo;Hunter (melee specialisation)&rdquo;, but replace &ldquo;Bow
Mastery&rdquo; with &ldquo;Crossbow Mastery&rdquo;, &ldquo;Arrow Bomb&rdquo;
with &ldquo;Iron Arrow&rdquo;, and so on.

### Ranger (archery specialisation)

Note that third and fourth job builds can vary considerably just depending on
implementation, since it depends on what version of the game you are playing,
what balance changes have been applied, and what training spots are accessible
and/or worthwhile. Also, these builds are inherently flexible, and will
inevitably vary from player to player. Pay close attention to the skill
descriptions at _all_ levels of each skill when deciding how to modify these
builds to fit.

With that in mind, this guide assumes that the skills are identical to the
MapleLegends implementation.

At level 70 we get a point into Strafe, since this is usually superior to maxed
Double Shot. Then we immediately get Arrow Rain to a level (25) that is useful
and effective for training and general multi-target combat; note that level 5
of Mortal Blow is a requirement to put any SPs into Arrow Rain. Level 25 of
Arrow Rain is also the point beyond which you no longer get quite as many
percentage points of damage per SP spent in it. One point is put into Inferno
for use in luring mobs; Arrow Bomb could be used for this, except that Arrow
Bomb stuns, and thus prevents the lured mobs from immediately coming towards
you. From there we max Strafe, since it never falls off in terms of the
damage-percentage-point benefit per SP invested. Then we come back to Arrow
Rain to max it out and thus maximize effectiveness in multi-target combat.

We then max out Silver Hawk (note that level &ge;5 Puppet is a requirement for
Silver Hawk). This helps to increase single-target DPS and also is a useful
little stun that you don&rsquo;t really have to do anything for (no need to use
Arrow Bomb and pray that it works). Then we squeeze some SPEED out of Thrust by
getting it to level 10. Note that after level 10, Thrust only grants 1 SPEED
per SP spent, instead of 2 SPEED. Now that mobility is largely out of the way,
we take Inferno to 16, which maxes out the distance over which it is effective.
Taking this skill to level 16 (rather than leaving it at level 1) is _almost
purely_ for the extra distance, as the damage is basically irrelevant (but some
extra damage can be nice). Note that Inferno is your mob luring skill forever,
i.e. it is not replaced by any fourth job skills.

We then max Puppet for the utility of it; 6000 HP is considerable enough that
it can typically take at least a single hit without going down. The rest of
your SP can be spent basically anywhere; Thrust and Mortal Blow are the usual
suspects here.

There are a lot of things that you can tweak here, and you should definitely
think about what you really want from your skill build, even adjusting it on
the fly as you get comfortable using these skills.

This build starts by getting the third-job archery basics out of the way. Once
we have access to Strafe (much better single-target DPS than your level 7
Double Shot), Arrow Rain (technically worse mobbing than your maxed Arrow Bomb,
but much more versatile since it cannot be stymied by enemies that are too
close to you), and Inferno (for luring mobs), we go ahead and max Silver Hawk.
Note that level &ge;5 Puppet is a pre-requisite for Silver Hawk. Silver Hawk is
our bread and butter for third job, since it provides us with both a bit of DPS
and a bit of crowd control, even while we&rsquo;re in melee.

After Silver Hawk, we want level 10 Thrust in order to be more mobile, which is
useful regardless or whether you are meleeing or ranging, but particularly when
meleeing (since you have to be in melee range!). Then comes Puppet, another
useful skill that can be used in melee. And once that is maxed, we go ahead an
finish up Thrust.

Beyond this point, this build is essentially the same as the
archery-specialised ranger build.

There are a lot of things that you can tweak here, and you should definitely
think about what you really want from your skill build, even adjusting it on
the fly as you get comfortable using these skills.

### Sniper (archery specialisation)

Note that third and fourth job builds can vary considerably just depending on
implementation, since it depends on what version of the game you are playing,
what balance changes have been applied, and what training spots are accessible
and/or worthwhile. Also, these builds are inherently flexible, and will
inevitably vary from player to player. Pay close attention to the skill
descriptions at _all_ levels of each skill when deciding how to modify these
builds to fit.

This build is an example build similar to the archery-specialised one given for
rangers. The main difference here is that we actually want to get Blizzard to
level 21 (as opposed to level 16, as with Inferno), because we only care about
the freeze duration, and the freeze duration peaks at level 21.

If you&rsquo;re playing on a server that has fourth job, it&rsquo;s acceptable
to not max Golden Eagle, so long as you get it to at least level 15.

See the comments on the ranger (archery specialisation) skill build.

### Sniper (melee specialisation)

See the ranger (melee specialisation) build. In order to get level 21 Blizzard,
you will have to make up 5 SP from somewhere. Where you get these 5 SP &mdash;
or if you just don&rsquo;t bother, and instead leave Blizzard at level 11 or
similar &mdash; is totally up to you.

## Itemization

A woodsman is nothing without her equipment and her gear&hellip;

### Equipment

#### Armaments

##### Archery

The armaments of archery that are available to the woodsman are fairly obvious:
with their base DEX permanently stuck at exactly 25, the woodsman has no choice
but to favor armaments with no DEX requirements (or low DEX requirements). The
breakdown, by character level, looks vaguely like this (note that, of course,
you can always skip certain weapons, or acquire them later on):

|        level | armaments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

If you plan on advancing to crossbowman at level 30, you might want to buy up a bunch of these and try your hand at scrolling them, if possible, because it will likely have to last you until level 35, at the least.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|  15&ndash;17 | Because the Composite Bow only has a DEX requirement of 40 (thus requiring just &ge;15 DEX from your other equipment), it makes a good choice here, if you can equip it. Unlike the Crossbow, the Composite Bow actually drops from a small handful of monsters, so it is even possible to try to get some above-average ones and then try your hand at scrolling those. Or you can just buy them up from Karl and scroll those. If you choose to advance to hunter at level 30, this will likely have to suffice until level 35, at the least.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|  18&ndash;34 | If you can manage to equip the Battle Crossbow (requires &ge;55 DEX, meaning &ge;30 from equipment!), and you plan on advancing to crossbowman at level 30, you might try your hand at scrolling one here. Otherwise, just keep whatever you&rsquo;ve been using.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|  35&ndash;42 | Finally, some maple weapons. If you&rsquo;re a hunter, you&rsquo;ve the Maple Bow. If you&rsquo;re a crossbowman, you&rsquo;ve the Maple Crow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|  43&ndash;63 | If you haven&rsquo;t switched to a maple weapon already, or you just want an upgrade right now, there&rsquo;s the Maple Soul Searcher for hunters, and the Maple Crossbow for crossbowmen. If you&rsquo;re playing on an implementation that lacks maple weapons, you may want to revisit exactly which archery weapons you can equip (given the amount of DEX you&rsquo;re getting from your other equipment) and how you can optimize them as much as possible, through scrolling, and possibly also through getting above-average drops of said weapons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|           64 | If you are fortunate enough to be playing on an implementation that has the full set of 2008 GMS Three Year Anniversary Event maple weapons, then you can make a considerable upgrade at this level: for Hunters, the Maple Kandiva Bow; for crossbowmen, the Maple Nishada.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 65&ndash;200 | Again, depending on your implementation<sup>\[1\]</sup>, hunters may have an alternative to the Maple Kandiva Bow (with a level requirement of 65, rather than 64): the Bow of Magical Destruction. Whether or not this is a better choice than the Maple Kandiva Bow is situational. Assuming that both bows cost you equally much (unlikely, given that the Maple Kandiva Bow is an event-specific weapon, and the Bow of Magical Destruction drops from an ordinary monster), and assuming that both bows are completely clean and have average stats, the Maple Kandiva Bow is somewhat superior: identical WATK, a faster speed (5 (&ldquo;Fast&rdquo;) vs. the Bow of Magical Destruction&rsquo;s 6 (&ldquo;Normal&rdquo;)), a slightly better knockback rate (48% &gt; 47%), and a nifty +100 MAXHP. The Bow of Magical Destruction, on the other hand, is potentially easier to optimize (as it drops from an ordinary monster), and gives a (probably negligible, but nevertheless nice) +1 AVOID. |

<details>
<summary>Footnotes for &ldquo;Archery&rdquo;</summary>

\[1\]: The earliest attestation of this weapon that I can find is from
2007-05-04 at the latest (actually predating the 2008 GMS Three Year
Anniversary Event (2008-05-07 &ndash; 2008-06-10) by almost exactly a year),
[due to MapleTip][mapletip-bomd]. However, it&rsquo;s unclear at what point
this weapon actually became _available_ in the game, as it would (at some
point) drop from the ordinary level 64 monster, Leader B (exclusive to Zipangu)
&mdash; yet, MapleTip lacks this knowledge, and so it is possible that the
weapon&rsquo;s info was available in the `*.wz` files only, before the weapon
properly existed in the game. The earliest attestation (that I could find with
a quick search) of the Bow of Magical Destruction actually existing in the game
is from 2011-01-07, exactly one month _after_ Big Bang. Notably, however,
MapleLegends (v62), MapleRoyals (v62&ndash;83), and MapleSaga (v62) all have
this bow.

##### Melee

Because archers/hunters/crossbowmen/&amp;c. are not designed to be melee jobs,
the choice of melee armaments for woodsmen looks fairly similar to that for a
closely related odd job: the permabeginner. As such, this section will mostly
just highlight the _differences_ w.r.t. melee armaments for woodsmen, as
compared to melee armaments for permabeginners.

Woodsmen obviously do not have access to any permabeginner-specific armaments;
this means no access to any of the following:

- The level 20 Frozen Tuna
- Sake Bottle
- Maroon Mop

Woodsmen do, however, have access to a small handful of armaments that
permabeginners do not have access to, although they are unfortunately limited
to low levels:

- Wooden Sword (level 10)
- Metal Axe (level 10)
- Wooden Mallet (level 10)
- Monkey Wrench (level 25)

The Monkey Wrench is of particular note due to being the highest level of these
four, although its expected DPS (assuming zero DEX and assuming that the
monster has zero WDEF) is roughly 98.88% that of a Fish Spear; however, the
expected damage per hit is roughly 114.7% that of the Fish Spear under the same
conditions. This advantage for the Monkey Wrench is, of course, amplified by
higher monster WDEF.

#### Shields

An archer? Wearing a shield? Blasphemy! But with woodsmen, anything is
possible. When engaging in melee and using a one-handed weapon, you will, of
course, want a shield. As usual, the Maple Shield is the most powerful, simply
because it has three extra slots, and you&rsquo;ll be wanting to scroll for
WATK (and/or STR). More accessible are the Stolen Fence (available from an NPC
and as a monster drop) and the Pan Lid (available as a reasonably common
monster drop). The Palette sports better defense than the Stolen Fence or Pan
Lid, and the LUK that it grants is useful for the accuracy (and avoidability).
My preference is the Stone Shield, if the implementation even has it, due to
its superior defense. The Black Phoenix Shield (again, if the implementation
even has it) is superior to either the Stolen Fence or the Pan Lid, and has
twice as much MDEF (and WDEF) as the Maple Shield.

#### Headgear

Woodsmen, unfortunately, do not have access to any of the bowman-specific
headgear. They can, of course, equip the level 10 hats, but there is no reason
to, considering that better hats (all with no job requirements) can be
purchased from NPCs as well. There is, however, one notable exception: if you
are fortunate enough to be playing on an implementation that has the extended
first-job quests (in the archer&rsquo;s case, culminating in a battle with the
Amdusias boss monster), you can (and must!) obtain the level 18 Amdusias Hat.
This hat is so powerful as to almost be comparable to a good Zakum Helmet.

If you cannot obtain the Amdusias Hat, you still have some good options
(&ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; methods of availability &mdash; that is, NPCs, (party)
quests, monster drops, and crafting &mdash; are bolded):

This brings us to the ideal end-game hats: Zakum Helmets, and
&ldquo;Scar/Tar&rdquo; (Scarlion and Targa) hats. These headgears are so
incredibly powerful that they need no introduction. Zakum Helmets are generally
more accessible, as Zakum tends to be run fairly often in most implementations,
and only requires level 50 (instead of the level 80 of Scar/Tar hats). Scar/Tar
hats aren&rsquo;t really better than Zakum Helmets, although it depends on what
you want to optimize for; obviously, the ideal Scar/Tar hat for a woodsman is
generally a Scarlion Hat (DEX).

When it comes to scrolling headgear, obviously you ideally want to scroll for
DEX, but scrolling for ACC is similarly good, and even 10%/30% DEF scrolls can
give a +1 ACC, which could be nice. Scrolling for HP is also viable for obvious
reasons. All-stat hats can be effectively Chaos Scrolled, if you&rsquo;re
feeling really saucy, or somehow have a large supply of Chaos Scrolls.

#### Clothing

Again, like with headgear, woodsmen unfortunately largely lack access to
bowman-specific attire of this kind (tops, bottoms, and overalls). This, again,
puts the woodsman in a similar situation as their permabeginner counterparts.
The idea here is to scroll an overall for DEX &mdash; unfortunately, tops
cannot be scrolled for DEX, although you _could_ go the unusual-but-viable
route of scrolling a bottom for DEX and scrolling a top for STR, or similar.
This leaves you with essentially two options: bathrobes, and sauna robes.

Bathrobes:

- Are able to be purchased from an NPC, and thus highly available for scrolling.
- Have a lower level requirement (20 &lt; 30).
- Give a nice SPEED boost (+10 SPEED), but are defensively inferior (+20 WDEF
  &lt; +30 WDEF; +0 AVOID &lt; +10 AVOID).

Sauna robes, on the other hand:

- Are more difficult to acquire, since you have to do a rather difficult quest
  (and one that has a minimum level requirement of 30) just to get one.
- Have a higher level requirement (30 &gt; 20).
- Are defensively superior (+30 WDEF &gt; +20 WDEF; +10 AVOID &gt; +0 AVOID),
  but do not grant any SPEED.

The fact that bathrobes can be purchased from an NPC makes them, by and large,
the clear favorite, since we really care about the scrolling outcome, not the
base stats of the armour.

#### Footwear

Again, not much bowman-specific footwear here, unless you have access to
Amdusias Shoes, in which case, just use those. The plan here is to scroll for
DEX (unless you end up with Facestompers, in which case you might(&#x203d;) try
Chaos Scrolling before scrolling for DEX).

The usual suspects here are:

| level | name                  | availability      | notable stats                                  | notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

#### Gloves

Again, no access to bowman-specific gloves. Generally, there are two kinds of
gloves that you might want: gloves scrolled for WATK, and gloves scrolled for
DEX/ACC. The usual suspects here are obvious: various colors of Work Gloves,
Green Mittens, various colors of Markers, &amp;c. Scrolling for WATK is ideal,
although scrolling for DEX/ACC can be useful when you are having accuracy
troubles and/or troubles getting enough DEX to equip something.

#### Capes

Not much to say here, since capes work essentially the same, regardless of
build. The ideal here is a pink cape that is Chaos Scrolled for WATK and/or
scrolled for DEX.

#### Earrings

You will, predictably, want to scroll your earrings for DEX. To this end,
earrings that can be purchased from NPCs (and possibly others that are
similarly easy to farm) are likely going to be what you end up with. However,
there are some earrings that come with stats (particularly, DEX) right out of
the box:

| level | name                                          | availability    | notable stats            | notes                                                                                                                                           |
| ----: | :-------------------------------------------- | :-------------- | :----------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    45 | Piercing of the Free Spirit                   | **quest**       | +1 all-stat, 4 slots     | May be available if your implementation has all of the Kerning Square quests implemented. Unfortunately only 4 slots (rather than the usual 5). |
|    50 | Altaire Earrings; Glittering Altaire Earrings | **party quest** | +1 all-stat; +2 all-stat | May be available as a reward for Ellin Party Quest.                                                                                             |
|    80 | Gold Emerald Earrings                         | rare drop       | +2 DEX                   | Dropped by The Boss. Good luck getting a pair. Also gives +5 INT.                                                                               |

#### Eyewear

We&rsquo;re mostly looking for DEX and ACC here. Eyewear can be scrolled for
ACC (and 10%/30% scrolls for eyewear for ACC will give +1 DEX on success).
Eyewear is the same for all jobs, essentially, but of particular note here are
Broken Glasses (+1 all-stat, available from LPQ) and Spectrum Goggles (+1 STR,
+1 DEX, gachapon-only).

#### Facewear

Again, mostly looking for DEX and ACC. Facewear is easier to scroll for DEX
than Eyewear, simply because scrolls for facewear for AVOID will give DEX on
success, even in the case of 60%/70% scrolls (as opposed to only giving DEX on
the success of 10%/30% scrolls). Of particular note are Sad Masks, which give
an average of +10 ACC out of the box. There are also various other face
accessories that may or may not be available, depending on your implementation,
and the ones that you&rsquo;ll want are generally any that give WATK and/or DEX
and/or STR and/or ACC right out of the box. However, anything with slots can be
scrolled with AVOID scrolls.

### Other items

#### Potions/food/drinks

As a woodsman, you want all of the WATK that you can get. To this end, you will
probably want potions/food/drinks that give WATK buffs. This is true regardless
of whether you are engaging in melee, or in archery, particularly because your
expected damage capabilities in both of these areas are going to be subpar when
compared to ordinary (non-odd) jobs specialized in these areas (warriors and
archers, respectively). Being smart with how you acquire and use WATK buffs can
help to narrow this gap. For WATK buffs that are available from NPCs
(&ldquo;WATK&sdot;s/meso&rdquo; is the magnitude of the WATK buff given,
multiplied by the duration, divided by the price per unit, and
&ldquo;meso/s&rdquo; is the cost of one second of the buff):

Also, be warned that these only allow up to 5 per stack, so they use up inventory space very inefficiently. |

The items here are in ascending order of WATK, breaking any ties by sorting in
ascending order of WATK&sdot;s/meso. The two stand-out items here (in the
absence of Coke Town) are the Warrior Pill and the Cider. Both are tied for
first place w.r.t. WATK&sdot;s/meso, with the Warrior Pill being the low-cost
but low-WATK alternative to the higher-cost but higher-WATK Cider. This makes
Ciders great for doing big damage without breaking the bank or running into
scarcity (as you might with items that give WATK buffs greater than +20), and
Warrior Pills great for a WATK buff that you can have on at all times for a
very low meso cost (just 0.833 meso/s!).

With Coke Town, Ciders are still useful (they are still the largest WATK buff),
but Coke Pills are then firmly in first place with respect to WATK&sdot;s/meso,
and Coke Zero Pills become very viable as well, due to being the largest WATK
buff that is _inventory-space efficient_. Ciders are burdened by only stacking
up to 5 per inventory slot<sup>\[1\]</sup> (they are **not** burdened by the
&minus;5 ACC debuff, because that is easily cancelled out); as a result, if you
want the highest store-bought WATK buff possible, _and_ you haven&rsquo;t the
inventory space for Ciders, Coke Zero Pills are your best bet &mdash; or
Warrior Elixirs, in the absence of Coke Town. Other entries here (besides
Ciders, Coke Pills, Coke Lite Pills, Coke Zero Pills, Warrior Pills, and
Warrior Elixirs) are either not useful, or are situationally useful when you
happen to be near an NPC that sells them.

Also of note are accuracy potions/food/drinks. For woodsmen that are doing more
of the &ldquo;melee specialised&rdquo; kind of build (see above), these are not
really of much concern, since you get access to useful levels of the Focus
skill relatively early on. For other woodsmen, I recommend the use of Sniper
Pills (+10 WACC for 10 minutes, available for 500 mesos a pop in Ludibrium)
until you get Focus to at least level 10. Of course, you only have to use these
on an as-needed basis.

vary; the &ldquo;5&rdquo; figure used here is based on MapleLegends.

#### Ammunition

Like potions/food/drinks that give WATK buffs, ammunitions that give WATK buffs
are a useful way to eke out a few extra WATK, whenever you are engaging in
archery. Particularly, the cheapest kind are bronzed ammunition, which grant +1
WATK and can be purchased from various NPCs (in the Aquarium, Ludibrium, KFT,
Leafre, and the Omega Sector) for 10 mesos per unit (20k mesos for a ream of 2k
units)<sup>\[1\]</sup>. More beneficial are colored ammunition (red for arrows,
blue for quarrels), which grant a whopping +4 WATK, and can be purchased in
Showa Town for 40 mesos per unit (80k mesos for a ream of 2k
units)<sup>\[2\]</sup>; diamond ammunition grants the same bonus for half the
price<sup>\[3\]</sup>, although diamond ammunition can only be purchased by
those who are allies of the Raven Ninja Clan.

Note that although we are using two thousand as a &ldquo;ream&rdquo; here
&mdash; because that is the size of a stack of normal arrows<sup>\[4\]</sup>
&mdash; bronzed ammunition stacks up to 1.8k per slot<sup>\[4\]</sup>, and
colored ammunition up to 1k<sup>\[4\]</sup>. Also note that when Soul Arrow is
active, you cannot benefit from any special ammunition.

MapleLegends-specific note: Diamond ammunition is actually superior to coloured
ammunition in MapleLegends, granting 5 WATK instead of 4. If possible, I
recommend getting access to [Mo&rsquo;s
store](https://bbb.hidden-street.net/npc/mo) (i.e. becoming an ally of the
Raven Ninja Clan); he sells Ciders, diamond ammunition, All Cure Potions,
Return to New Leaf City Scrolls, and some other possibly useful stuff.
MapleLegends also tweaked prices to be generally cheaper for arrows and
quarrels, and made them stack more readily per-slot. So you have little excuse
to use Soul Arrow in MapleLegends!
