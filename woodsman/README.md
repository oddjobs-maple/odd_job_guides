Meanwhile Ulysses, as long as his arrows lasted, had been shooting the suitors
one by one, and they fell thick on one another: when his arrows gave out, he
set the bow to stand against the end wall of the house by the door post, and
hung a shield four hides thick about his shoulders; on his comely head he set
his helmet, well wrought with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly
above it, and he grasped two redoubtable bronze-shod spears.

"The woodsman, variously wielding the Composite Bow and the Monkey Wrench")

The **woodsman** is an odd job/odd build in MapleStory that, at its core,
represents the ability to both competently wield weapons of archery (bows
and/or crossbows) _and_ competently wield weapons of melee combat (spears,
polearms, swords, &amp;c.). Sindits _can_ parallel the woodsman&rsquo;s ability
to do both ranged &amp; melee physical DPS, but where the sindit is a
mainstream build designed merely to overcome the awkward early power curve of
dagger-wielding rogues, the woodsman represents a genuine dedication to the
classical martial arts. With that dedication comes a totally different skillset
and array of playstyles that makes the woodsman both unique, and redoubtable in
the eyes of mortals.

## A quick note on the name

This job is referred to throughout this document as &ldquo;woodsman&rdquo;
(plural &ldquo;woodsmen&rdquo;). This job is also commonly referred to by
simply prepending &ldquo;STR&rdquo; (or &ldquo;strength&rdquo;) to the name of
the ordinary job in question &mdash; e.g. &ldquo;STR hunter&rdquo; &mdash; or
more generically as &ldquo;STR archer&rdquo;.

&ldquo;Woodsman&rdquo;/&ldquo;woodsmen&rdquo; unfortunately can sound rather
gendered, and so &ldquo;woodswoman&rdquo; (plural &ldquo;woodswomen&rdquo;) is
sometimes used instead, when appropriate &mdash; although this only solves one
of the problems. Rather than attempting to fix the English language and write a
MapleStory guide in one fell swoop, &ldquo;woodsman&rdquo; and
&ldquo;woodsmen&rdquo; are here used as gender-neutral, catch-all terms.

## Pros and cons

Discussing the pros and cons of the woodsman as a job can only be done with the
understanding that the woodsman _is an odd job_, and is therefore inherently
suboptimal in many ways (if it weren&rsquo;t, we would be very lucky indeed to
be able to call it an &ldquo;odd&rdquo;, or &ldquo;unusual&rdquo;, job).

Pros:

- Ability to switch between ranged combat and melee combat.
- Ability to do ranged combat at all as an odd job, considering that most odd
  jobs are essentially stuck with melee only.
- Fairly powerful mobbing, starting from level 30 and onwards.
- Less accuracy issues than many other jobs (including some odd jobs), due to
  having a head-start on their DEX (25), focusing on DEX for equipment, and
  having skills like The Blessing of Amazon, Focus, and even (w.r.t. ranged
  combat) mastery skills.
- Gets a relatively powerful mob manipulation skill by second job: Power
  Knock-Back.
- Does considerably more bow-whacking damage than ordinary archers, which is
  accentuated once the woodsman has access to Power Knock-Back.
- Has the possibility of eventually getting Sharp Eyes as a skill.
- Enviable aesthetics.

Cons:

- Switching between ranged combat and melee combat is not as seamless as one
  would hope, because you cannot be in an &ldquo;alert&rdquo; (i.e.
  &ldquo;catching your breath&rdquo;) stance while switching weapons. Contrast
  this with gishes, who may not be able to do _physical_ ranged damage, but can
  nevertheless cast ranged spells and do physical melee combat, both without
  switching weapons at all.
- Considerably worse accuracy in comparison to an ordinary archer, due to
  having a base DEX of exactly 25.
- Unfortunately not as good at ranged combat, nor at melee combat, as some
  other jobs are (particularly non-odd jobs, i.e. ordinary/mainstream jobs).
  Given the same equipment, any ordinary archer build (STRless or otherwise)
  will be able to outperform you at range (although you will outperform them at
  melee, of course) easily. Any warrior, bandit, or brawler build that could be
  considered &ldquo;standard&rdquo; or &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; in any way will
  be able to outperform you in melee from at least second job onwards, and
  likely earlier as well (although you will outperform them at range, of
  course).

## AP build

Woodsmen are defined, in part, by having a base (that is, not including bonuses
from equipment or buffs) DEX of exactly 25. _Technically_, as long as you
satisfy that constraint, any AP build is valid. However, only one such AP build
actually makes sense, and that is leaving your base DEX, INT, and LUK at 25, 4,
and 4, respectively, and putting all other APs into STR.

## Skill builds

Skill builds can be _quite_ flexible here, so I&rsquo;ve split skill builds
into essentially two routes: the wannabe DEX archer (here called &ldquo;archery
specialisation&rdquo;), and the wannabe permabeginner-but-with-skills (here
called &ldquo;melee specialisation&rdquo;). Not only are these obviously not
the only two viable skill builds, but their names are also perhaps misleading.
The &ldquo;melee specialist&rdquo; is perfectly adept at archery from second
job onwards (and is good enough to be useful in first job), and the
&ldquo;archery specialist&rdquo; is perfectly adept at melee, even if they can
suffer from more accuracy issues during early second job (albeit not quite as
many issues as many other melee jobs).

### Archer (archery specialisation)

|       level | SP allocation                                          |
| ----------: | :----------------------------------------------------- |
|          10 | +1 Arrow Blow \[1\]                                    |
|          11 | +3 The Blessing of Amazon \[3\]                        |
| 12&ndash;13 | +3 The Eye of Amazon \[6\]                             |
|          14 | +2 The Eye of Amazon \[**MAX**\], +1 Double Shot \[1\] |
| 15&ndash;20 | +3 Double Shot \[19\]                                  |
|          21 | +1 Double Shot \[**MAX**\], +2 Critical Shot \[2\]     |
| 22&ndash;27 | +3 Critical Shot \[**MAX**\]                           |
| 28&ndash;30 | +3 The Blessing of Amazon \[12\]                       |

By level 30:

| skill                  |  level | max level |
| :--------------------- | -----: | --------: |
| The Blessing of Amazon |     12 |        16 |
| **The Eye of Amazon**  |  **8** |     **8** |
| **Critical Shot**      | **20** |    **20** |
| Focus                  |      0 |        20 |
| **Double Shot**        | **20** |    **20** |
| Arrow Blow             |      1 |        20 |

This first-job SP allocation strategy is essentially identical to your typical
archer&rsquo;s. The only thing that might surprise some people is that we leave
Focus at level 0. Why leave Focus at 0 and spend those SPs on The Blessing of
Amazon, when you could spend them on Focus and get both accuracy _and_
avoidability? The simple answer is that buffs of the same kind (e.g. two
different accuracy buffs) do **not** stack. This effectively means that Focus
is useless at levels below 11, and situationally, it may even be useless at max
level; Sniper Pills (available from any of 3 different NPCs in Ludibrium for
roughly 500 mesos a pop) already give a +10 accuracy buff, and there are other
consumables that give even more powerful accuracy buffs (including, but not
limited to, Maple Pops, which drop from two distinct species of low-level
monsters and grant a +100 accuracy buff). Plus, having a Cleric in your party
typically negates the usefulness (due to Bless), and the avoidability component
is already obsoleted by the Archer Elixir (available from an NPC in New Leaf
City for 5k mesos a pop), which grants a +20 avoidability buff. The Blessing of
Amazon, on the other hand, is a _passive_ skill, and thus stacks with
everything.

### Archer (melee specialisation)

|       level | SP allocation                                            |
| ----------: | :------------------------------------------------------- |
|          10 | +1 Arrow Blow \[1\]                                      |
| 11&ndash;15 | +3 The Blessing of Amazon \[15\]                         |
|          16 | +1 The Blessing of Amazon \[**MAX**\], +2 Focus \[2\]    |
| 17&ndash;20 | +3 Focus \[14\]                                          |
|          21 | +2 Focus \[16\], +1 The Eye of Amazon \[1\]              |
| 22&ndash;23 | +3 The Eye of Amazon \[7\]                               |
|          24 | +1 The Eye of Amazon \[**MAX**\], +2 Critical Shot \[2\] |
| 25&ndash;30 | +3 Critical Shot \[**MAX**\]                             |

By level 30:

| skill                      |  level | max level |
| :------------------------- | -----: | --------: |
| **The Blessing of Amazon** | **16** |    **16** |
| **The Eye of Amazon**      |  **8** |     **8** |
| **Critical Shot**          | **20** |    **20** |
| Focus                      |     16 |        20 |
| Double Shot                |      0 |        20 |
| Arrow Blow                 |      1 |        20 |

This build starts out with one point into Arrow Blow, because that single SP is
enough to grant you a ranged single-target DPS skill that is significantly
superior to simply basic-attacking with your (cross)bow. You can, if you want,
forgo Arrow Blow entirely in favor of getting Focus up to level 17 (instead of
level 16) by the time that you&rsquo;re level 21; however, I expect that for
most people, a single SP is worth it here. Because we are focusing on melee
combat (for _at least_ first job), we don&rsquo;t have to frontload any
archery-specific skills, and can also safely leave Double Shot at level 0
without sacrificing performance of our main second-job attack, Arrow Bomb/Iron
Arrow. For this reason, we instead frontload accuracy boosts in order to allow
ourselves to fight higher-level and higher-avoidability monsters at lower
character levels. In order to not totally neglect archery (again, particularly
because we will be getting Arrow Bomb/Iron Arrow at level 30), we do still need
to max The Eye of Amazon, as well as Critical Shot. For this reason, we stop
putting SPs into Focus once the skill is at level 16 (rather than at level 20,
the maximum level of the skill). See the &ldquo;Archer (archery
specialisation)&rdquo; skill build section for a justification on why we
prioritise The Blessing of Amazon over Focus.

### Hunter (archery specialisation)

|       level | SP allocation                                               |
| ----------: | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
|          30 | +1 Arrow Bomb \[1\]                                         |

|          37 | +2 Bow Mastery \[**MAX**\], 1 Bow Booster \[1\]             |
|          38 | +3 Bow Booster \[4\]                                        |
|          39 | +2 Bow Booster \[6\], +1 Arrow Bomb \[2\]                   |
| 40&ndash;48 | +3 Arrow Bomb \[29\]                                        |
|          49 | +1 Arrow Bomb \[**MAX**\], +2 The Blessing of Amazon \[14\] |
|          50 | +2 The Blessing of Amazon \[**MAX**\], +1 Focus \[1\]       |
| 51&ndash;56 | +3 Focus \[19\]                                             |
|          57 | +1 Focus \[**MAX**\], +2 Power Knock-Back \[2\]             |
| 58&ndash;63 | +3 Power Knock-Back \[**MAX**\]                             |
|          64 | +2 Soul Arrow: Bow \[2\], +1 Bow Booster \[7\]              |
| 65&ndash;66 | +2 Bow Booster \[11\], +1 Soul Arrow: Bow \[4\]             |
|          67 | +3 Bow Booster \[14\]                                       |
| 68&ndash;70 | +2 Bow Booster \[**MAX**\], +1 Soul Arrow: Bow \[7\]        |

By level 70:

| skill                      |  level | max level |
| :------------------------- | -----: | --------: |
| **The Blessing of Amazon** | **16** |    **16** |
| **The Eye of Amazon**      |  **8** |     **8** |
| **Critical Shot**          | **20** |    **20** |
| **Focus**                  | **20** |    **20** |
| **Double Shot**            | **20** |    **20** |
| Arrow Blow                 |      1 |        20 |
|                            |        |           |
| **Bow Mastery**            | **20** |    **20** |
| Final Attack: Bow          |      0 |        30 |
| **Bow Booster**            | **20** |    **20** |
| **Power Knock-Back**       | **20** |    **20** |
| Soul Arrow: Bow            |      7 |        20 |
| **Arrow Bomb**             | **30** |    **30** |

We start with the basics here: one point into Arrow Bomb to be able to use it,
and then max Bow Mastery for the damage, accuracy, and damage stability. Then
we immediately dip into Bow Booster to get it to a one minute duration of extra
fast shootin&rsquo;. Then Arrow Bomb is maxed, to increase the damage and the
stun proc chance of our main attacking skill.

At this point, all of the super essential stuff is out of the way, which means
that we can get back to dumping SP into first-job skills in order to salvage as
many precious and much-needed points of accuracy as possible. First is maxing
The Blessing of Amazon, for reasons outlined in the &ldquo;Archer (archery
specialisation)&rdquo; skill build section. Then we get a little greedy and go
directly from level 0 Focus to maxed Focus; it&rsquo;s OK to leave this for
last or whatever, especially if you aren&rsquo;t having any accuracy problems
or your accuracy problems wouldn&rsquo;t be ameliorated by Focus, but
I&rsquo;ve put it here because it doesn&rsquo;t cause you to really put off any
super important skills. If you expect to _always_ have at least a +20 accuracy
buff from other sources, then Focus isn&rsquo;t much good, but we&rsquo;re
assuming that maxing Focus is at least resonably important, since it allows you
to _guarantee_ that you really do _always_ have at least a +20 accuracy buff.

Then we max Power Knock-Back, made even more powerful by your stronk arms.
Finally, the rest of the SPs go into Bow Booster and Soul Arrow, keeping the
two as close as possible in terms of duration. Why put off Soul Arrow for so
long (first acquired at level 64)? For two main reasons:

1. The reality is that Soul Arrow is a convenience skill; that is, with just a
   bit of quiver management, the need for Soul Arrow is all but eliminated. Not
   using Soul Arrow is mostly an issue for inventory space.
2. While ordinary archers are constantly seeking more DEX and more WATK in
   order to boost their damage output ever higher, I would argue that woodsmen
   have this same need, but even more intensely. As a woodsman using an
   ordinary archer&rsquo;s weapon, you are constantly fighting the fact that
   you are DEXless, and yet are wielding a weapon whose main damage stat is
   DEX. In your quest to ameliorate this problem as much as you can, one
   accessible source of WATK is that of the WATK bonuses granted by your
   ammunition. Particularly, the cheapest kind are bronzed ammunition, which
   grant +1 WATK and can be purchased from various NPCs for 10 mesos per unit
   (20k mesos for a ream of 2k units). More beneficial are colored ammunition
   (red for arrows, blue for quarrels), which grant a whopping +4 WATK, and can
   be purchased in Showa Town for 40 mesos per unit (80k mesos for a ream of 2k
   units); diamond ammunition grants the same bonus for half the price,
   although diamond ammunition can only be purchased by those that are allies
   of the Raven Ninja Clan. When Soul Arrow is active, you cannot benefit from
   any special ammunition.

All of that being said, if you, for example, are playing on a server where you
are starved for &ldquo;use&rdquo; inventory space, you can simply slip in the
first two levels of Soul Arrow somewhere earlier in the build.

This skill build ends up being more similar to the &ldquo;archery
specialised&rdquo; hunter, in comparison to the more stark difference between
their first jobs. As a result, many of the justifications for these skill
builds are more-or-less the same, so refer to the &ldquo;Hunter (archery
specialisation)&rdquo; skill build for those.

One difference here is that the &ldquo;melee specialised&rdquo; hunter had a
significantly different first-job skill build, which affects the exact course
of the second-job skill build. Also, we prioritise Power Knock-Back over ranged
single-target DPS, because the &ldquo;melee specialised&rdquo; hunter probably
just wants to melee when the situation arises to be dealing single-target DPS.
The &ldquo;melee specialised&rdquo; hunter (generally) pulls out their bow for
one skill and one skill only: Arrow Bomb. Power Knock-Back helps to control
mobs that get close enough to disallow Arrow Bomb from being used. Double Shot
is neglected because by the time that you would ever get around to using it,
you would already be level 70 and have level 1 Strafe.

### Crossbowman (archery specialisation)

with &ldquo;Iron Arrow&rdquo;, and so on.
